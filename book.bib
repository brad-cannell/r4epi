              learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful
              structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book,
              you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a
              chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you'll
              learn how to clean data and draw plots---and many other things
              besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen,
              and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these
              things with R. You'll learn how to use the grammar of graphics,
              literate programming, and reproducible research to save time.
              You'll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate
              discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.",

               fifty years of experience, providing detailed step-by-step
               guidance designed to help students and researchers write and
               present scientific manuscripts more successfully through
               knowledge, practice, and an efficient approach. Retaining the
               user-friendly style of the previous editions, this fourth
               edition has been broadened to include detailed information
               relevant to today's digital world. It covers all aspects of the
               writing process, from first drafts, literature retrieval, and
               authorship to final drafts and electronic publication. A new
               section provides extensive coverage of ethical issues, from
               plagiarism and dual publication to honesty in reporting
               statistics. Both the text and 30 hands-on exercises include

                  addresses - or really any kind of programming at all - are
                  named with spaces inside of the title. The reasoning behind
                  this is very simple. Empty space signifies the ``end'' of a
                  character string. Spaces inside of a URL or a linked file
                  basically generate a faulty syntax that the server reads as
                  the end of a character string. The server sees ``the end''
                  and stops processing. When the full string is not processed,
                  it can not be properly represented on your computer screen.",

  abstract = "Advances in computing technology have spurred two extraordinary
              phenomena in science: large-scale and high-throughput data
              collection coupled with the creation and implementation of
              complex statistical algorithms for data analysis. These two
              phenomena have brought about tremendous advances in scientific
              discovery but have raised two serious concerns. The complexity of
              modern data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility
              of the analyses, meaning the ability of independent analysts to
              recreate the results claimed by the original authors using the
              original data and analysis techniques. Reproducibility is
              typically thwarted by a lack of availability of the original data
              and computer code. A more general concern is the replicability of
              scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which
              scientific claims are confirmed by completely independent
              investigations. Although reproducibility and replicability are
              related, they focus on different aspects of scientific progress.
              In this review, we discuss the origins of reproducible research,
              characterize the current status of reproducibility in public
              health research, and connect reproducibility to current concerns
              about the replicability of scientific findings. Finally, we
              describe a path forward for improving both the reproducibility
              and replicability of public health research in the future.",

  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",
