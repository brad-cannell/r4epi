<!-- Moved this text over from the intro chapter. -->

<!-- For now, I think I just want to include stuff about creating DAGs in the book. Trying to distill all of causal inference into a single chapter is biting off more than I can chew right now. -->

The field of statistics has produced many tools that we can use to quantify, and therefor estimate, the effect of random error if we are willing to make certain assumptions. Similarly, pioneers in the field of causal inference (e.g., Judea Pearl, Jamie Robbins, Sander Greenland, and Miguel Hernán) have refined and tested tools that allow us to estimate average causal effects from observational data if we are willing to make certain assumptions. One of those tools -- the one we will focus on in this chapter – is called a **directed acyclic graph**, or **DAG** for short. A very simple DAG is shown here. 

```{r dags-load-packages, echo=FALSE}
# Load the packages we will need below
# This isn't actually shown to readers yet. I only want them to see the DAG at 
# this point. We will repeat this code block below even though it isn't really
# needed in our R session.
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggdag, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r dags-first-simple-dag, echo=FALSE}
# Create the DAG
simple_dag <- dagify(
  y ~ x,
  exposure = "x",
  outcome = "y",
  labels = c("x" = "Exposure", "y" = "Outcome"),
  coords = list(
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0)
  )
) 

# Plot simple dag
ggdag(simple_dag) +
  theme_dag()
```

Putting it simply, DAGs are just graphs that help us tell a _story_ about causes and effects. For example, perhaps the `X` node in the DAG above represents the position of a light switch and and the `Y` node in the DAG above represents the status of a light bulb (on vs. off). Then, the causal story that DAG above would tell is that changing the position of the light switch _causes_ the light bulb to turn on and off. Because it is a graph, the entire story of causes and effect is summarized into a compact visual representation. More importantly, it turns out that these graphs, powered by a mathematical language called _graph theory_ contain mathematical information that will eventually allow us to make estimates of causal effects, if we are willing to accept some assumptions. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the basic nuts and bolts of DAGs; as well as how to create DAGs with R. In future chapters, we will progressively learn more about _using_ DAGs as a tool for causal inference. 

## Basic DAG structures and vocabulary

DAGs are made from **nodes** and **edges**. In figure \@ref(fig:dags-nodes-and-edges), `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are nodes, and `A` and `B` are edges. You may see the DAGs where the nodes are literal dots, and you may see DAGs that use variable names as the nodes. Figure \@ref(fig:dags-nodes-and-edges) has an example of each. Nodes represent the variables we are modeling, and edges encode the _relationship_ between the variables we are modeling.

Two nodes are said to be **adjacent** to each other if there is an edge connecting them. For example, `X` and `Y` are adjacent in figure \@ref(fig:dags-nodes-and-edges), but `X` and `Z` are not.

Edges can be **directed** or **undirected**. Edges that are directed have an arrowhead on at least one end, and edges that are undirected do not. Edges `A` and `B` in figure \@ref(fig:dags-nodes-and-edges) are both directed because they both have an arrowhead on one end. The "start" or "out" side of a directed edge is the side that doesn't have an arrowhead, and the "end" or "in" side does have an arrowhead. For example, edge `A` in figure \@ref(fig:dags-nodes-and-edges) starts at node `X` and ends at node `Y`. If all of the edges in a graph are directed, then the graph is said to be a **directed graph**.

Are the graphs in figure \@ref(fig:dags-nodes-and-edges) both directed graphs?

Yes, the are both directed graphs because all of the edges are directed. 

When there are two nodes connected by a directed edge, the start of the edge is the **cause** and the end of the edge is the **effect**. So, the story figure \@ref(fig:dags-nodes-and-edges) tells is that `X` causes `Y` and `Y` causes `Z`. 

```{r dags-nodes-and-edges, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic DAG Structures: Nodes and edges."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/13_causal_inference/01_intro_causal_inference/nodes_and_edges.png")
```

Relationships between nodes in a DAG are often described in terms of family relationships. The node a the start of a directed edge is called a **parent** of the node the directed edge ends at. Conversely, the node at the end of the directed edge is called a **child** of the node the directed edge started from. In \@ref(fig:dags-descendants), `X` is a parent of `Y` and a grandparent of `Z`. Equivalently, `Y` is a child of `X` , `Z` is a child of `Y`, and `Z` is a grandchild of `X`. 

<!-- Try to add these labels directly in R at some point. -->

```{r dags-descendants, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic DAG Structures: Descendants."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/13_causal_inference/01_intro_causal_inference/descendants.png")
```

A **directed path** (often simply referred to as a path) is any arrow-based route between two variables on the graph. In \@ref(fig:dags-paths), there is a path from `X` to `Y`, from `Y` to `Z`, and from `X` to `Z` that goes through `Y`. Paths are either open or closed according to D-separation rules, which we will discuss soon.

```{r dags-paths, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic DAG Structures: Paths."}
# Create the DAG
dagify(
  y ~ x,
  z ~ y,
  coords = list(
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
  )
) |> 

# Plot the dag
ggdag() +
  theme_dag()
```

When there is at least one directed path from a node that leads back to itself, then the graph is said to be **cyclic**. In figure \@ref(fig:dags-paths), there is a path -- from `X` to `Y` to `Z` to `X` -- that begins and ends at `X`. Therefore, the graph in figure \@ref(fig:dags-paths) is cyclic. If there are no cyclic paths in a graph (as is the case in every other graph we've seen in this chapter), then the graph is said to be **acyclic**. When our graphs are directed and acyclic, then they are called **directed acyclic graphs** or **DAG**s. 

```{r dags-cyclic, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic DAG Structures: A cyclic graph."}
# Create the DAG
dagify(
  y ~ x,
  z ~ y,
  x ~ z,
  coords = list(
    x = c(x = 1, y = 3, z = 2),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 1)
  )
) |> 

# Plot the dag
ggdag() +
  theme_dag()
```

**Colliders** exist where two arrowheads “collide” into a node. For example, in \@ref(fig:dags-colliders-01), the arrow from `X` to `Y` and the arrow from `Z` to `Y` "collide" into each other at `Y`.

```{r dags-colliders-01, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic DAG Structures: Colliders."}
# Create the DAG
dagify(
  y ~ x,
  y ~ z,
  coords = list(
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
  )
) |> 

# Plot the dag
ggdag() +
  theme_dag()
```

Note that colliders are _path specific_. For example, `Y` is a collider on the `X` -> `Y` <- `Z` path in figure \@ref(fig:dags-colliders-02), but it is not a collider on the `X` -> `Y` -> `W` path. 

```{r dags-colliders-02, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic DAG Structures: A slightly more complex collider."}
# Create the DAG
dagify(
  y ~ x,
  y ~ z,
  w ~ y,
  coords = list(
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3, w = 2),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 1)
  )
) |> 

# Plot the dag
ggdag() +
  theme_dag()
```

**Common causes** are another important concept when using DAGs. In figure \@ref(fig:dags-common-causes), `Y` is a common cause of `X` and `Z`. We know this because an arrow points from `Y` to `X` and from `Y` to `Z`. 

It’s important to note that _statistical associations_ can follow any path regardless of the direction of the arrows (in the absence of colliders). However, _causal effects_ only follow the direction of the arrows (assuming our assumptions are correct). So, in this case, we expect `X` to be associated with `Z` even though `X` does not cause `Z`. We can also say that `Y` confounds the relationship (or lack of relationship) between `X` and `Z`. **Confounding** is one of the most critical concepts in all of epidemiology, and it has an entire [chapter][Confounding] devoted to it later in the book. 

```{r dags-common-causes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic DAG Structures: Common causes."}
# Create the DAG
dagify(
  x ~ y,
  z ~ y,
  coords = list(
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
  )
) |> 

# Plot the dag
ggdag() +
  theme_dag()
```

## Creating DAGs in R

There are a number of R packages we can use to create and analyze DAGs in R. [DAGitty](https://www.dagitty.net/) is a popular tool for creating and DAGs. Notably, DAGitty has a graphical interface we can use to create, edit, and analyze DAGs directly in our web browser. We can access DAGitty in our browser by navigating to https://www.dagitty.net/ and clicking on `Launch DAGitty online in your browser`, which is the far left box of figure \@ref(fig:dags-dagitty) below.

```{r dags-dagitty, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Screenshot of the DAGitty homepage."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/13_causal_inference/03_dags/dagitty_screenshot.png")
```

You might have also noticed the `dagitty` R package in figure \@ref(fig:dags-dagitty). It's a great package that allows us to use DAGitty directly from within an R session, and I encourage interested readers to check it out. However, for the sake of efficiency, we will focus on using a different R package, built on top of `dagitty`, `ggplot2`, and `ggraph`, for the remainder of this chapter. That package is called [ggdag](https://github.com/r-causal/ggdag).

```{r dags-load-packages-again}
# Load the packages we will need below
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggdag, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Chains

The first DAG structure we will learn how to create with `ggdag` called a **chain**. A chain consists of 3 nodes and two edges, with one edges going into the middle node and the other edge coming out of the middle node. @Pearl2016-lu We have already seen several examples of chains above, for example, figure \@ref(fig:dags-paths). Let's look at the code we used to create figure \@ref(fig:dags-paths).

```{r dags-chain-01}
# Create a DAG called chain
chain <- dagify(
  y ~ x, # The form is effect ~ cause
  z ~ y,
  # Optionally add coordinates to control the placement of the nodes on the DAG
  coords = list( 
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
  )
)

# Plot the dag
ggdag(chain) +
  theme_dag()
```

Now, let's walk through building the code step-by-step to better understand how it works.

```{r dags-chain-02}
# Create a DAG called chain
chain <- dagify(
  y ~ x # The form is effect ~ cause
) 

# Print the value stored in chain to the screen
chain
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

- We used the `dagify()` function to create an object called `chain` that contains some code used by the DAGitty package to create DAGs. 

  - You can type `?dagify` into your R console to view the help documentation for this function and follow along with the explanation below.
  
  - The first argument to the `dagify()` function is the `...` argument. The value(s) passed to the `...` argument should be formula(s). The formulas should have the form _effect ~ cause_. Where _effect_ and _cause_ are both nodes we want to be included in the DAG. In this cause, we passed the value `y ~ x`, which means "y is caused by x." This value simultaneously tells the `dagify()` function two things. First, that the DAG needs to have a `y` node and an `x` node if it doesn't already. Second, that there should be a directed edge in the DAG from `x` to `y`.
  
  - Finally, the `dagify()` function converts our formula into `DAGitty` syntax, which `ggdag` uses under the hood. 

- We can see the `DAGitty` syntax when we print the value stored in `chain` to the screen. However, we won't actually need to manipulate this code in any way.

Next, we can pass the `chain` object the the `ggdag()` function to print our DAG to the screen.

```{r dags-chain-03}
# Set seed so that we can reproduce the plot
set.seed(123)

# Plot the chain dag and print it to the screen
ggdag(chain)
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

- We used the `ggdag()` function to plot the `chain` object as a `ggplot2` plot and print it to the screen.

  - You can type `?ggdag` into your R console to view the help documentation for this function and follow along with the explanation below.
  
  - The first argument to the `ggdag()` function is the `.tdy_dag` argument. The value passed to the `.tdy_dag` should be a `tidy_dagitty` object or a `dagitty` object. We passed a `dagitty` object -- `chain`.
  
- The DAG was converted to a `ggplot2` plot and printed to the screen. Notice the x and y axis values in the plot above. These values don't have any substantive meaning. They are simply coordinates used to place the elements of the graph around the plotting area. By default, if we don't tell the `dagify()` function which coordinates to use, then it will select coordinates at random. Therefore, if we want our DAG to look the same every time we run the code above, then we must either use the `set.seed()` function to produce the same random coordinates each time we run the code _or_ we much specifically pass coordinates to the `dagify()` function. 

Let's pass coordinates to the the `dagify()` function now so that we have greater control over the layout and reproducibility of our DAG.

```{r dags-chain-04}
# Create a DAG called chain
chain <- dagify(
  y ~ x, # The form is effect ~ cause
  # Optionally add coordinates to control the placement of the nodes on the DAG
  coords = list( 
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0)
  ) 
) 

# Plot the chain dag and print it to the screen
ggdag(chain)
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

- We used the `dagify()` function to create an object called `chain` that contains some code used by the DAGitty package to create DAGs.

  - We passed a list of coordinates to the `coords` argument.
  
    - The list of coordinates must have an `x` element and a `y` element.
    
    - The `x` element must contain a named vector of `x` coordinate values. The names correspond to node names and the values correspond the `x` coordinate value we want each node to have. For example, `x = c(x = 1, y = 2)` tells the `dagify()` function that we want the center of the `x` node to be placed on the plot at the spot where the x-axis is equal to 1. Similarly, it tells the `dagify()` function that we want the center of the `y` node to be placed on the plot at the spot where the x-axis is equal to 2. When we look at the DAG, we can see that the `x` node and `y` node were plotted in those locations. There is nothing magic about choosing the values `1` and `2`. We could have selected any value for `x` that is less than some other arbitrary value for `y` and the graph would still look the same. We just happen to think that integer values are easier to work with.
    
    - The `y` element must contain a named vector of `y` coordinate values. The names correspond to node names and the values correspond the `y` coordinate value we want each node to have. For example, `y = c(x = 0, y = 0)` tells the `dagify()` function that we want the center of the `x` node and the center of the `y` node to both be placed on the plot at the spot where the y-axis is equal to 0. When we look at the DAG, we can see that the center of the `x` node and the `y` node both cross the y-axis at 0. There is nothing magic about choosing the value `0`. We just happen to think that integer values are easier to work with.

- We used the `ggdag()` function to plot the `chain` object as a `ggplot2` plot and print it to the screen.

Now that we know how the coordinate system work, it no longer serves much of a purpose. The x- and y-axis values don't have any function beyond placing nodes on the plotting area. So, let's go ahead and remove them. The `ggdag` package includes a function called `theme_dag()` that will remove everything from the plot except the nodes and edges. Let's use it now.

```{r dags-chain-05}
# Create a DAG called chain
chain <- dagify(
  y ~ x, # The form is effect ~ cause
  # Optionally add coordinates to control the placement of the nodes on the DAG
  coords = list( 
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0)
  ) 
) 

# Plot the chain dag and print it to the screen
ggdag(chain) + # Make sure to use a + sign, not a pipe
  theme_dag()
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

- We used the `ggdag()` function to plot the `chain` object as a `ggplot2` plot and print it to the screen.

- This time we added the `theme_dag()` theme to our plot to make it easier to read. Notice that we used the `+` sign to add the theme, not a pipe operator. 

At this point, we have learned all of the basic functionality we need to know to create our chain DAG. We just need to add one more node and one more edge. 

```{r dags-chain-05}
# Create a DAG called chain
chain <- dagify(
  y ~ x, # The form is effect ~ cause
  z ~ y,
  # Optionally add coordinates to control the placement of the nodes on the DAG
  coords = list( 
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
  ) 
) 

# Plot the chain dag and print it to the screen
ggdag(chain) + # Make sure to use a + sign, not a pipe
  theme_dag()
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

- We used the `dagify()` function to create an object called `chain` that contains some code used by the DAGitty package to create DAGs.

  - We added another formula, `z ~ y`, to the `...` argument, which means "z is caused by y." This value simultaneously tells the `dagify()` function two things. First, that the DAG needs to have a `z` node and a `y` node if it doesn't already. Second, that there should be a directed edge in the DAG from `y` to `z`.
  
  - We added another set of coordinates to the `coords` argument. The told the `dagify()` function that we want the center of the `z` node to be placed on the plot at the spot where the x-axis is equal to 3 and the y-axis is equal to 0.
  
- We used the `ggdag()` function to plot the `chain` object as a `ggplot2` plot and print it to the screen.

## Forks

The next structure we will learn to create with `ggdag` is the **fork** structure. A fork consists of 3 nodes and two edges, with both edges coming out of the middle node. @Pearl2016-lu We previously saw a fork when we discussed common causes and figure \@ref(fig:dags-common-causes). Here is the code we used to create figure \@ref(fig:dags-common-causes). 

```{r}
# Create the DAG called common_cause
common_cause <- dagify(
  x ~ y,
  z ~ y,
  coords = list(
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
  )
) 

# Plot the common_cause dag and print it to the screen
ggdag(common_cause) +
  theme_dag()
```

The code above only differs from the chain code in the formulas we passed the `...` argument of the `dagify()` function. This time, the formulas we passed told the `dagify()` function that "x is caused by y" (`x ~ y`) and that "z is caused by y" (`z ~ y`). Everything else remained the same.

## Collider 

The third structure we will learn to create with `ggdag` is the **collider** structure. A collider consists of 3 nodes and two edges, with both edges directed into the middle node. @Pearl2016-lu We previously saw a collider in \@ref(fig:dags-colliders-01). Here is the code we used to create figure \@ref(fig:dags-colliders-01). 

```{r}
# Create the DAG called collider
collider <- dagify(
  y ~ x,
  y ~ z,
  coords = list(
    x = c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3),
    y = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
  )
)

# Plot the collider dag and print it to the screen
ggdag(collider) +
  theme_dag()
```

The code above only differs from the chain code in the formulas we passed the `...` argument of the `dagify()` function. This time, the formulas we passed told the `dagify()` function that "y is caused by x" (`y ~ x`) and that "y is caused by z" (`y ~ z`). Everything else remained the same.

With only these three structures -- chains, forks, and colliders -- we can create sophisticated DAGs with the potential to help us reason about almost any causal question we may want to ask. However, before we can use our DAGs, we must understand the d-separation rules.

## d-Separation Rules

# 🔴 Left off here...

Now that we understand the basic structures that make up DAGs, we can use the rules of D-separation to estimate average causal effects from DAGs when all assumptions are met. Here they are in their totality. Let’s quickly look at each in isolation.

1. If there are no variables being conditioned on, a path is blocked if and only if two arrowheads on the path collide at some variable on the path.
2. Any path that contains a non-collider that has been conditioned on is blocked.
3. A collider that has been conditioned on does not block a path. 
4. A collider that has a descendant that has been conditioned on does not block a path.
5. Two variables are D-separated if all paths between them are blocked.

```{r dags-d-separation-01, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/13_causal_inference/01_intro_causal_inference/d_separation_01.png")
```

The first path is open. The second path is closed.

```{r dags-d-separation-02, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/13_causal_inference/01_intro_causal_inference/d_separation_02.png")
```

The first path is open. The second path is closed.

```{r dags-d-separation-03, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/13_causal_inference/01_intro_causal_inference/d_separation_03.png")
```

The first path is closed The second path is open.

```{r dags-d-separation-04, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/13_causal_inference/01_intro_causal_inference/d_separation_04.png")
```

Because we conditioned on W, the path X -> Y <- Z is open.

As the course progresses, we will use the rules of D-separation to better understand, and potentially control for, bias and confounding.

Now, let’s practice a little bit more.


## Comparing DAGs and RMSCC

Answers two different questions.

“The sufficient component cause model considers sets of actions, events, or states of nature which together inevitably bring about the outcome under consideration. The model gives an account of the causes of a particular effect. It addresses the question, ‘Given a particular effect, what are the various events which might have been its cause?’” @Hernan2020-uu

“The potential outcomes or counterfactual model focuses on one particular cause or intervention and gives an account of the various effects of that cause. In contrast to the sufficient component cause framework, the potential outcomes framework addresses the question, ‘What would have occurred if a particular factor were intervened upon and thus set to a different level than it in fact was?’ Unlike the sufficient component cause framework, the counterfactual framework does not require a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms by which the factor affects the outcome.’ @Hernan2020-uu

<!-- Note from PP: Move this slide (below) to the end after we talk about what DAGs are. -->

The last bullet is key. You’ve all heard that association or correlation does not equal causation, which is true. But, if you are willing to accept the assumptions baked into the qualitative causal model (the graph picture), and you follow the rules of D-separation in your analysis, then any statistical associations ARE casual effects. 

The remaining controversy and uncertainty around DAGs comes for the “if you are willing to accept the assumptions” part of what I just said. The assumptions are not always reasonable and can’t always be tested directly. However, even in the absence of complete certainty, DAGs have shown themselves to be a useful tool in epidemiology over and over. 

- Not magic, just a tool.
- Works because it encodes mathematical information, given assumptions.
- Association flows in both directions
- No distinction between Causal / Preventive (listens to).
- Made of nodes and edges (arrows).
- Arrows must go in one direction (i.e., not double-headed).
- Acyclic – Never get back to where you started if you follow arrows.
- Arrows indicate causal effects.
- Deleting arrows indicates a lack of a causal effect.
- Simultaneously qualitative causal models and statistical models.
