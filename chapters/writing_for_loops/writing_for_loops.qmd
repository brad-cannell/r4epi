In this third chapter on repeated operations, we are going to discuss writing [for loops](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-for-loops).

```

In other documents you read, you may see for loops referred to as iterative processing, iterative operations, iteration, or just loops. Regardless of what you call them, for loops are not unique to R. Many if not all statistical software applications allow users to write for loops; although, the exact words and symbols used to construct them may differ slightly from one program to another. 

Let's take a look at an example. After seeing a working example, we will take the code apart iteratively (do you see what we did there? 😆) to figure out how it works. 

We'll start by simulating some data. This is the same data we simulated at the beginning of the chapter on column-wise operations in `dplyr`. It's a data frame that contains three columns of 10 random numbers:

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
set.seed(123)
df_xyz <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10),
  y = rnorm(10),
  z = rnorm(10)
) %>% 
  print()
```

As we previously discussed, if we wanted to find the mean of each column before learning about repeated operations, we would probably have written code like this:

```{r}
df_xyz %>% 
  summarise(
    x_mean = mean(x),
    y_mean = mean(y),
    z_mean = mean(y)
  )
```

In the previous chapter, we learned how to use the `across()` function to remove unnecessary repetition from our code like this:

```{r}
df_xyz %>%
  summarise(
    across(
      .cols  = everything(),
      .fns   = mean,
      .names = "{col}_mean"
    )
  )
```

An alternative approach that would also work is to use a for loop like this:

```{r}
xyz_means <- vector("double", ncol(df_xyz))

for(i in seq_along(df_xyz)) {
  xyz_means[[i]] <- mean(df_xyz[[i]])
}
```

```{r}
xyz_means
```

Most people would agree that the for loop code is a little more complicated looking, and it's a little bit harder to quickly glance at it and figure out what's going on. It may even be a little bit intimidating for some of you.

Also, note that the result from the code that uses the `across()` function is a data frame with three columns and one row. The result from the code that uses a for loop is a character vector with three elements.

For the particular case above, we prefer to use the `across()` function instead of a for loop. However, as we will see below, there are some challenges that can be overcome with for loops that cannot currently be overcome with the `across()` function. But, before we jump into more examples, let's take a look at the basic structure of the for loop.

## How to write for loops

For starters, _using_ for loops in practice will generally require us to write code for two separate structures: An object to contain the results of our for loop and the for loop itself.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-two-structures-1
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Two structures required for a for loop
knitr::include_graphics("two_structures.png")
```

In practice, we will generally write the code for structure 1 before writing the code for structure 2. However, it will be easier to understand why we need structure 1 if we first learn about the components of the for loop, and how they work together. Further, it will likely be easiest to understand the components of the for loop if we start on the inside and work our way out. Therefore, the first component of for loops that we are going to discuss is the body.

### The for loop body

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-body
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Body of the for loop
knitr::include_graphics("body.png")
```

Similar to when we learned to write our own functions, the body of the for loop is where all the "stuff" happens. This is where we write the code that we want to be executed over and over. In our example, we want the mean value of the `x` column, the mean value of the `y` column, and the mean value of the `z` column of our data frame called `df_xyz`. We can do that manually like this using dollar sign notation:

```{r}
mean(df_xyz$x)
mean(df_xyz$y)
mean(df_xyz$z)
```

Or, we've also learned how to get the same result using bracket notation:

```{r}
mean(df_xyz[["x"]])
mean(df_xyz[["y"]])
mean(df_xyz[["z"]])
```

In the code above, we used the quoted column _names_ inside the double brackets. However, we could have also used each column's _position_ inside the double brackets. In other words, we can use `1` to refer to the `x` column because it is the first column in the data frame, we can use `2` to refer to the `y` column because it is the second column in the data frame, and we can use `3` to refer to the `z` column because it is the third column in the data frame:

```{r}
mean(df_xyz[[1]])
mean(df_xyz[[2]])
mean(df_xyz[[3]])
```

For reasons that will become clearer later, this will actually be the syntax we want to use inside of our for loop. 

Notice, however, the we copied the same code more than twice above. For all of the reasons we've already discussed, we would like to just type `mean(df_xyz[[ # ]]` once and have R fill in the number inside the double brackets for us, one after the other. As you've probably guessed, that's exactly what the for loop does.

### The for() function

All for loops start with the `for()` function. This is how you tell R that you are about to write a for loop.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-for
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: The for() function
knitr::include_graphics("for.png")
```

In the examples in this book, the arguments to the `for()` function are generally going to follow this pattern:

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-for2
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Pattern of the for() function arguments
knitr::include_graphics("for2.png")
```

1️⃣An index variable, which is also sometimes called a "counter," to the left of the keyword `in`.

2️⃣The keyword `in`.

3️⃣The name of the object we want to loop (or iterate) over — often passed to the` seq_along()` function. 

It can be a little intimidating to look at, but that's the basic structure. We will talk about all three arguments simultaneously because they all work together, and we will get an error if we are missing any one of them:

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(i)
```

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
# No index variable
for(in 1) {
  print(i)
}
```

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
# No keyword "in"
for(i 1) {
  print(i)
}
```

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
# No object to loop over
for(i in ) {
  print(i)
}
```

So, what happens when we do have all three of these components? Well, the index variable will take on each value of the object to loop over _iteratively_ (i.e., one at a time). If there is only one object to loop over, this is how R sees the index variable inside of the loop:

```{r}
for(i in 1) {
  print(i)
}
```

If there are multiple objects to loop over, this is how R sees the index variable inside of the loop:

```{r}
for(i in c(1, 2, 3)) {
  print(i)
}
```

Notice that the values being printed out are _not_ a single numeric vector with three elements (e.g. `[1] 1, 2, 3`) like the object we started with to the right of the keyword `in`. Instead, three vectors with one element each are being printed out. One for 1 (i.e., `[1] 1`), one for 2 (i.e., `[1] 2`), and one for 3 (i.e., `[1] 3`). This is pointed out because it illustrates the _iterative_ nature of a for loop. The index variable doesn't take on the values of the object to the right of the keyword `in` _simultaneously_. It takes them on _iteratively_, or separately, one after the other.

Further, it may not be immediately obvious at this point, but that's the basic "magic" of the for loop. _The index variable changes once for each element of whatever object is on the right side of the keyword `in`_. Even the most complicated for loops generally start from this basic idea.

Note that the index variable does not have to be the letter `i`. It can be any letter:

```{r}
for(x in c(1, 2, 3)) {
  print(x)
}
```

Or even a word:

```{r}
for(number in c(1, 2, 3)) {
  print(number)
}
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(i, number, x)
```

However, `i` is definitely the most common letter to use as the index variable and we suggest that you also use it in most cases. It's just what people will expect to see and easily understand.

Now, let's discuss the object to the right of the keyword `in`. In all of the examples above, we passed a vector to the right of the keyword `in`. As you saw, when there is a vector to the right of the keyword `in`, the index variable takes on the value of each element of the vector. However, the object to the right of the keyword `in` does not have to be a vector. In fact, it will often be a data frame. 

When we ask the for loop to iterate over a data frame, what value do you think the index variable will take? The value of each cell of the data frame? The name or number of each column? The name or number of each row? Let's see:

```{r}
for(i in df_xyz) {
  print(i)
}
```

It may not be totally obvious to you, but inside the for loop above, the index variable took on three separate _vectors_ of values -- one for each column in the data frame. Of course, getting the mean value of each of these _vectors_ is equivalent to getting the mean value of each _column_ in our data frame. Remember, data frame columns _are_ vectors. So, let's replace the `print()` function with the `mean()` function in the for loop body and see what happens:

```{r}
for(i in df_xyz) {
  mean(i)
}
```

Hmmm, it doesn't seem as though anything happened. This is probably a good time to mention a little peculiarity about using for loops. As you can see in the example above, the return value of functions, and the contents of objects, referenced inside of the for loop body will not be printed to the screen unless we explicitly pass them to the `print()` function:

```{r}
for(i in df_xyz) {
  print(mean(i))
}
```

It worked! This is the exact same answer we got above. And, if all we want to do is print the mean values of `x`, `y`, and `z` to the screen, then we could stop here and call it a day. However, we often want to save our analysis results to an object. In the chapter on using column-wise operations with `dplyr`, we saved our summary statistics to an object in the usual way (i.e., with the assignment arrow):

```{r}
xyz_means <- df_xyz %>%
  summarise(
    across(
      .cols  = everything(),
      .fns   = mean,
      .names = "{col}_mean"
    )
  )
```

From there, we can manipulate the results, save the results to a file, or print them to screen:

```{r}
xyz_means
```

At first, it may seem as though we can assign the results of our for loop to an object in a similar way:

```{r}
xyz_means <- for(i in df_xyz) {
  mean(i)
}
```

```{r}
xyz_means
```

Unfortunately, this doesn't work. Instead, we need to create an object that can store the results of our for loop. Then, we _update_ (i.e., add to) that object at each iteration of the for loop. That brings us back to structure number 1.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-two-structures-2
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Two structures required for a for loop
knitr::include_graphics("two_structures.png")
```

Because the result of our for loop will be three numbers -- the mean of `x`, the mean of `y`, and the mean of `z` -- the most straightforward object to store them in is a numeric vector with a length of three (i.e., three "slots"). We can use the `vector()` function to create an empty vector:

```{r}
my_vec <- vector()
my_vec
```

As you can see, by default, the `vector()` function creates a logical vector with length zero. We can change the vector type to numeric by passing `"numeric"` to the `mode` argument of the `vector()` function. We can also change the length to 3 by passing `3` to the length argument of the `vector()` function, and because we know we want this vector to hold the mean values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, let's name it `xyz_means`:

```{r}
xyz_means <- vector("numeric", 3)
xyz_means
```

Finally, let's update `xyz_means` inside our for loop body:

```{r}
for(i in df_xyz) {
  xyz_means <- mean(i)
}
```

```{r}
xyz_means
```

Hmmm, we're getting closer, but that obviously still isn't the result we want. Below, we attempt to illustrate what's going on inside our loop. 

R starts executing at the top of the for loop. In the first iteration, the value of i is set to a numeric vector with the same values as the `x` column in `df_xyz`. Then, the `i` in `mean(i)` inside the for loop body is replaced with those numeric values. Then, the mean of those numeric values is calculated and assigned to the object named `xyz_means`.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-1-1
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process - I
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_1_1.png")
```

At this point, there is no more code left to execute inside of the for loop, so R returns to the top of the loop.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-1-2
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process - II
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_1_2.png")
```

`i` has not yet taken every value of the object to the right of the keyword `in`, so R starts another iteration of the for loop. In the second iteration, the value of `i` is set to a numeric vector with the same values as the `y` column in `df_xyz`. Then, the `i` in `mean(i)` inside the for loop body is replaced with those numeric values. Then, the mean of those numeric values is calculated and assigned to the object named `xyz_means`.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-1-3
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process - III
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_1_3.png")
```

At this point, there is no more code left to execute inside of the for loop, so R returns to the top of the loop.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-1-4
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process - IV
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_1_4.png")
```

`i` still has not yet taken every value of the object to the right of the keyword `in`, so R starts another iteration of the for loop. In the third iteration, the value of `i` is set to a numeric vector with the same values as the `z` column in `df_xyz`. Then, the `i` in `mean(i)` inside the for loop body is replaced with those numeric values. Then, the mean of those numeric values is calculated and assigned to the object named `xyz_means`.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-1-5-1
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process - V
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_1_5.png")
```

At this point, there is no more code left to execute inside of the for loop, so R returns to the top of the loop. However, this time, `i` has taken every value of the object to the right of the keyword `in`, so R does not start another iteration. It leaves the looping process, and the value of `xyz_means` remains `-0.4245589` -- The result we got above. 

You might be thinking, "wait, we made three slots in the `xyz_means` vector. Why does it only contain one number?" Well, remember that all we have to do to overwrite one object with another object is to assign the second object to the same name. For example, let's create a vector with three values called `my_vec`:

```{r}
my_vec <- c(1, 2, 3)
my_vec
```

Now, let's assign another value to `my_vec`:

```{r}
my_vec <- -0.4245589
my_vec
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(my_vec)
```

As you can see, assignment (`<-`) doesn't _add to_ the vector, it _overwrites_ (i.e., replaces) the vector. That's exactly what was happening inside of our for loop. To R, it basically looked like this:

```{r}
xyz_means <- 0.07462564
xyz_means <- 0.208622
xyz_means <- -0.4245589
xyz_means
```

What we really want is to create the empty vector:

```{r}
xyz_means <- vector("numeric", 3)
xyz_means
```

And then add a value to each _slot_ in the vector. Do you remember how to do this? 

We can do this using bracket notation:

```{r}
xyz_means[[1]] <- 0.07462564
xyz_means[[2]] <- 0.208622
xyz_means[[3]] <- -0.4245589
xyz_means
```

That's exactly the result we want. 

Does that code above remind you of any other code we've already seen? How about this code:

```{r}
mean(df_xyz[[1]])
mean(df_xyz[[2]])
mean(df_xyz[[3]])
```

Hmmm, what if we combine the two? First, let's once again create our empty vector, and then try combining the two code chunks above to fill it:

```{r}
xyz_means <- vector("numeric", 3)
xyz_means
```

```{r}
xyz_means[[1]] <- mean(df_xyz[[1]])
xyz_means[[2]] <- mean(df_xyz[[2]])
xyz_means[[3]] <- mean(df_xyz[[3]])
xyz_means
```

Again, that's exactly the result we want. Of course, there is still unnecessary repetition. If you look at the code carefully, you may notice that the only thing that changes from line to line is the number inside the double brackets. So, if we could just type `xyz_means[[ # ]] <- mean(df_xyz[[ # ]])` once, and update the number inside the double brackets, we should be able to get the result we want. We've actually already seen how to do that with a for loop too. Remember this for loop for the very beginning of the chapter:

```{r}
for(i in c(1, 2, 3)) {
  print(i)
}
```

That looks promising, right? Let's once again create our empty vector, and then try combining the two code chunks above to fill it:

```{r}
xyz_means <- vector("numeric", 3)
xyz_means
```

```{r}
for(i in c(1, 2, 3)) {
  xyz_means[[i]] <- mean(df_xyz[[i]])
}
```

```{r}
xyz_means
```

It works! We have used a for loop to successfully remove the unnecessary repetition from our code. However, there's still something we could do to make the code more robust. In the for loop above, we knew that we needed three iterations. Therefore, we passed `c(1, 2, 3)` as the object to the right of the keyword `in`. But, what if we didn't know exactly how columns there were? What if we just knew that we wanted to iterate over all the columns in the data frame passed to the right of the keyword `in`. How could we do that?

We can do that with the `seq_along()` function. When we pass a vector to the `seq_along()` function, it returns a sequence of integers with the same length as the vector being passed, starting at one. For example:

```{r}
seq_along(c(4, 5, 6))
```

Or:

```{r}
seq_along(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
```

Similarly, when we pass a data frame to the `seq_along()` function, it returns a sequence of integers with a length equal to the number of columns in the data frame being passed, starting at one. For example:

```{r}
seq_along(df_xyz)
```

Therefore, we can replace `for(i in c(1, 2, 3))` with `for(i in seq_along(df_xyz))` to make our code more robust (i.e., it will work in more situations):

```{r}
xyz_means <- vector("numeric", 3)

for(i in seq_along(df_xyz)) {
  xyz_means[[i]] <- mean(df_xyz[[i]])
}

xyz_means
```

Just to make sure that we really understand what's going on in the code above, let's walk through the entire process one more time. 

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-2-1
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process again - I
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_2_1.png")
```

R starts executing at the top of the for loop. In the first iteration, the value of i is set to the first value in `seq_along(df_xyz)`, which is `1`. Then, the `i` in `df_xyz[[i]]` inside the for loop body is replaced with `1`. Then, R calculates the mean of `df_xyz[[1]]`, which is `x` column of the `df_xyz` data frame. Finally, the mean value is assigned to `xyz_means[[i]]`, which is `xyz_means[[1]]` in this iteration. So, the value of the first element in the `xyz_means` vector is `0.07462564`.

At this point, there is no more code left to execute inside of the for loop, so R returns to the top of the loop. `i` has not yet taken every value of the object to the right of the keyword `in`, so R starts another iteration of the for loop. 

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-2-2
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process again - II
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_2_2.png")
```

In the second iteration, the value of i is set to the second value in `seq_along(df_xyz)`, which is `2`. Then, the `i` in `df_xyz[[i]]` inside the for loop body is replaced with `2`. Then, R calculates the mean of `df_xyz[[2]]`, which is `y` column of the `df_xyz` data frame. Finally, the mean value is assigned to `xyz_means[[i]]`, which is `xyz_means[[2]]` in this iteration. So, the value of the second element in the `xyz_means` vector is `0.20862196`.

At this point, there is no more code left to execute inside of the for loop, so R returns to the top of the loop. `i` still has not yet taken every value of the object to the right of the keyword `in`, so R starts another iteration of the for loop.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-2-3
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process again - III
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_2_3.png")
```

In the third iteration, the value of i is set to the third value in `seq_along(df_xyz)`, which is `3`. Then, the `i` in `df_xyz[[i]]` inside the for loop body is replaced with `3`. Then, R calculates the mean of `df_xyz[[3]]`, which is `z` column of the `df_xyz` data frame. Finally, the mean value is assigned to `xyz_means[[i]]`, which is `xyz_means[[3]]` in this iteration. So, the value of the third element in the `xyz_means` vector is `-0.42455887`.

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-iteration-1-5-2
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Illustration of a for loop process - V
knitr::include_graphics("iteration_1_5.png")
```

At this point, there is no more code left to execute inside of the for loop, so R returns to the top of the loop. However, this time, `i` has taken every value of the object to the right of the keyword `in`, so R does not start another iteration. It leaves the looping process, and the value of `xyz_means` remains `0.07462564, 0.20862196, -0.4245589`. 

There's one final adjustment we should probably make to the code above. Did you notice that when we create the empty vector to contain our results, we're still hard coding its length to `3`? For the same reason we replaced `for(i in c(1, 2, 3))` with `for(i in seq_along(df_xyz))`, we want to replace `vector("numeric", 3)` with `vector("numeric", length(df_xyz))`.

Now, let's add a fourth column to our data frame:

```{r}
df_xyz <- df_xyz %>% 
  mutate(a = rnorm(10)) %>% 
  print()
```

And see what happens when we pass it to our new, robust for loop code:

```{r}
xyz_means <- vector("numeric", length(df_xyz)) # Using length() instead of 3

for(i in seq_along(df_xyz)) { # Using seq_along() instead of c(1, 2, 3)
  xyz_means[[i]] <- mean(df_xyz[[i]])
}

xyz_means
```

Our for loop now gives us the result we want no matter how many columns are in the data frame. Having the flexibility to loop over an arbitrary number of columns wasn't that important in this case -- we knew exactly how many columns we wanted to loop over. However, what if we wanted to add more columns in the future? Using the second method, we wouldn't have to make any changes to our code. This is often an important consideration when we embed for loops inside of functions that we write ourselves.

For example, maybe we think, "that for loop above was really useful. I want to write it into a function so that I can use it again in our other projects." Well, we've already seen how to take our working code, embed it inside of a function, make it more general, and assign it a name. If you forgot how to do this, please review [the function writing process](../writing_functions/writing_functions.qmd#the-function-writing-process). In this case, that process would result in something like this:

```{r}
multi_means <- function(data) {
  # Create a structure to contain results
  result <- vector("numeric", length(data))
  
  # Iterate over each column of data
  for(i in seq_along(data)) {
    result[[i]] <- mean(data[[i]])
  }
  
  # Return the result
  result
}
```

Which we can easily apply to our data frame like this:

```{r}
multi_means(df_xyz)
```

Further, because we've made the for loop code inside of the function body flexible with `length()` and `seq_along()` we can easily pass any other data frame (with all numeric columns) to our function like this:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
new_df <- tibble(
  age    = rnorm(10, 50, 10),
  height = rnorm(10, 65, 5),
  weight = rnorm(10, 165, 10)
) %>% 
  print()
```

```{r}
multi_means(new_df)
```

If we want our for loop to return the results with informative names, similar those that are returned when we use the `across()` method, we can simply add one line of code to our for loop body that names each result:

```{r}
xyz_means <- vector("numeric", length(df_xyz))

for(i in seq_along(df_xyz)) {
  xyz_means[[i]] <- mean(df_xyz[[i]])
  names(xyz_means)[[i]] <- paste0(names(df_xyz)[[i]], "_mean") # Name results here
}

xyz_means
```

If it isn't quite clear to you why that code works, try picking it apart, replacing `i` with a number, and figuring out how it works. 

We can make our results resemble those returned by the `across()` method even more by converting our named vector to a data frame like this:

```{r}
xyz_means %>% 
  as.list() %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

Finally, we can update our `multi_means()` function with changes we made above so that our results are returned as a data frame with informative column names:

```{r}
multi_means <- function(data) {
  # Create a structure to contain results
  result <- vector("numeric", length(data))
  
  # Iterate over each column of data
  for(i in seq_along(data)) {
    result[[i]] <- mean(data[[i]])
    names(result)[[i]] <- paste0(names(data)[[i]], "_mean")
  }
  
  # Return the result as a tibble
  as_tibble(as.list(result))
}
```

```{r}
multi_means(new_df)
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(df_xyz, new_df, i, xyz_means, multi_means)
```

## Using for loops for data transfer

In the previous section, we used an example that wasn't really all that realistic, but it was useful (hopefully) for learning the mechanics of for loops. As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, rather than using a for loop for the analysis above, using `across()` with `summarise()` might be preferable.

However, keep in mind that `across()` is designed specifically for repeatedly applying functions column-wise (i.e., across columns) of a _single_ data frame in conjunction with `dplyr` verbs. By definition, if we are repeating code outside of `dplyr`, or if we are applying code across _multiple data frames_, then we probably aren't going to be able to use `across()` to complete our coding task.

For example, let's say that we have data stored across multiple sheets of an Excel workbook. This simulated data contains some demographic information about three different cities: Houston, Atlanta, and Charlotte. We need to import each sheet, clean the data, and combine them into a single data frame in order to complete our analysis. First, we will load the `readxl`package:

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

[You may click here to download this file to your computer.](https://github.com/brad-cannell/r4epi/blob/master/data/city_ses.xlsx)

Then, we may import each sheet like this:

```{r}
#| label: read-in-city-ses-xlsx-2
#| cache: TRUE
houston <- read_excel(
  "city_ses.xlsx",
  sheet = "Houston"
) %>% 
  print()
```

```{r}
#| label: read-in-city-ses-xlsx-3
#| cache: TRUE
atlanta <- read_excel(
  "city_ses.xlsx",
  sheet = "Atlanta"
) %>% 
  print()
```

```{r}
#| label: read-in-city-ses-xlsx-4
#| cache: TRUE
charlotte <- read_excel(
  "city_ses.xlsx",
  sheet = "Charlotte"
) %>% 
  print()
```

🚩In the code chunks above, we have essentially the same code copied more than twice. That's a red flag that we should be thinking about removing unnecessary repetition from our code. Of course, we could write our own function to reduce some of the repetition:

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(atlanta, charlotte, houston)
```

```{r}
import_cities <- function(sheet) {
  df <- read_excel(
    "city_ses.xlsx",
    sheet = sheet
  )
}
```

```{r}
houston <- import_cities("Houston") %>% print()
```

```{r}
atlanta <- import_cities("Atlanta") %>% print()
```

```{r}
charlotte <- import_cities("Charlotte") %>% print()
```

That method is better. And depending on the circumstances of your project, it may be the best approach. However, an alternative approach would be to use a for loop. Using the for loop approach might look something like this:

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(atlanta, charlotte, houston)
```

```{r}
# Save the file path to an object so we don't have to type it repeatedly 
# or hard-code it in.
path <-  "city_ses.xlsx"

# Use readxl::excel_sheets to get the name of each sheet in the workbook.
# this makes our code more robust.
sheets <- excel_sheets(path)

for(i in seq_along(sheets)) {
  # Convert sheet name to lowercase before using it to name the df
  new_nm <- tolower(sheets[[i]])
  assign(new_nm, read_excel(path, sheet = sheets[[i]]))
}
```

```{r}
houston
```

```{r}
atlanta
```

```{r}
charlotte
```

👆**Here's what we did above:**

* We used a for loop to import every sheet from an Excel workbook.

* First, we saved the path to the Excel workbook to a separate object. We didn't have to do this. However, doing so prevented us from having to type out the full file path repeatedly in the rest of our code. Additionally, if the file path ever changed, we would only have to update it in one place.

* Second, we used the `excel_sheets()` function to create a character vector containing each sheet name. We didn't have to do this. We could have typed each sheet name manually. However, there shouldn't be any accidental typos if we use the `excel_sheets()` function, and we don't have to make any changes to our code if more sheets are added to the Workbook in the future. 

* Inside the for loop, we assigned each data frame created by the `read_excel()` function to our global environment using the `assign()` function. We haven't used the `assign()` function before, but you can read the help documentation by typing `?assign` in your R console.

    - The first argument to the `assign()` function is `x`. The value you pass to `x` should be the name of the object you want to create. Above, we passed `new_nm` (for new name) to the `x` argument. At each iteration of the for loop, `new_nm` contained the name of each sheet in `sheets`. So, `Houston` at the first iteration, `Atlanta` at the second iteration, and `Charlotte` at the third iteration. Of course, we like using lowercase names for our data frames, so we used `tolower()` to convert `Houston`, `Atlanta`, and `Charlotte` to `houston`, `atlanta`, and `charlotte`. These will be the names used for each data frame assigned to our global environment inside of the for loop.
    
    - The second argument to the `assign()` function is `value`. The value you pass to `value` should be the contents you want to assign the object with the name you passed to the `x` argument. Above, we passed the code that imports each sheet of the `city_ses.xlsx` data frame to the `value` argument.
    
For loops can often be helpful for data transfer tasks. In the code above, we looped over sheets of a single Excel workbook. However, we could have similarly looped over file paths to import multiple different Excel workbooks instead. We could have even used nested for loops to import multiple sheets from multiple Excel workbooks. The code would not have looked drastically different. 

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(atlanta, charlotte, houston, i, new_nm, path, sheets, import_cities)
```

## Using for loops for data management

In the [chapter on writing functions](../writing_functions/writing_functions.qmd#the-function-writing-process), we created an `is_match()` function. In that scenario, we wanted to see if first name, last name, and street name matched at each ID between our data frames. More specifically, we wanted to combine the two data frames into a single data frame and create three new dummy variables that indicated whether first name, last name, and address matched respectively. 

Here are the data frames we simulated and combined:

```{r}
people_1 <- tribble(
  ~id_1, ~name_first_1, ~name_last_1, ~street_1,
  1,     "Easton",      NA,           "Alameda",
  2,     "Elias",       "Salazar",    "Crissy Field",
  3,     "Colton",      "Fox",        "San Bruno",
  4,     "Cameron",     "Warren",     "Nottingham",
  5,     "Carson",      "Mills",      "Jersey",
  6,     "Addison",     "Meyer",      "Tingley",
  7,     "Aubrey",      "Rice",       "Buena Vista",
  8,     "Ellie",       "Schmidt",    "Division",
  9,     "Robert",      "Garza",      "Red Rock",
  10,    "Stella",      "Daniels",    "Holland"
)
```

```{r}
people_2 <- tribble(
  ~id_2, ~name_first_2, ~name_last_2, ~street_2,
  1,     "Easton",      "Stone",      "Alameda",
  2,     "Elas",        "Salazar",    "Field",
  3,     NA,            "Fox",        NA,
  4,     "Cameron",     "Waren",      "Notingham",
  5,     "Carsen",      "Mills",      "Jersey",
  6,     "Adison",      NA,           NA,
  7,     "Aubrey",      "Rice",       "Buena Vista",
  8,     NA,            "Schmidt",    "Division",
  9,     "Bob",         "Garza",      "Red Rock",
  10,    "Stella",      NA,           "Holland"
)
```

```{r}
people <- people_1 %>% 
  bind_cols(people_2) %>% 
  print()
```

Here is the function we wrote to help us create the dummy variables:

```{r}
is_match <- function(value_1, value_2) {
  result <- value_1 == value_2
  result <- if_else(is.na(result), FALSE, result)
  result
}
```

And here is how we applied the function we wrote to get our results:

```{r}
people %>% 
  mutate(
    name_first_match = is_match(name_first_1, name_first_2),
    name_last_match  = is_match(name_last_1, name_last_2),
    street_match     = is_match(street_1, street_2)
  ) %>% 
  # Order like columns next to each other for easier comparison
  select(id_1, starts_with("name_f"), starts_with("name_l"), starts_with("s"))
```

🚩However, in the code chunk above, we still have essentially the same code copied more than twice. That's a red flag that we should be thinking about removing unnecessary repetition from our code. Because we are using dplyr, and all of our data resides inside of a single data frame, your first instinct might be to use `across()` inside of `mutate()` to perform column-wise operations. Unfortunately, that method won't work in this scenario. 

The `across()` function will apply the function we pass to the `.fns` argument to each column passed to the `.cols` argument, one at a time. But, we need to pass two columns at a time to the `is_match()` function. For example, `name_first_1` and `name_first_2`. There's really no good way to accomplish this task using `is_match()` inside of `across()`. However, it is fairly simple to accomplish this task with a for loop:

```{r}
cols <- c("name_first", "name_last", "street")

for(i in seq_along(cols)) {
  col_1   <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_1")
  col_2   <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_2")
  new_col <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_match")
  people[[new_col]] <- is_match(people[[col_1]], people[[col_2]])
}
```

```{r}
people %>% 
  select(id_1, starts_with("name_f"), starts_with("name_l"), starts_with("s"))
```

👆**Here's what we did above:**

* We used our `is_match()` function inside of a for loop to create three new dummy variables that indicated whether first name, last name, and address matched respectively.

Let's pull the code apart piece-by-piece to see how it works.

```{r}
cols <- c("name_first", "name_last", "street")

for(i in seq_along(cols)) {
  col_1   <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_1")
  col_2   <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_2")
  new_col <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_match")
  print(col_1)
  print(col_2)
  print(new_col)
}
```

First, we created a character vector that contained the base name (i.e., no `_1` or `_2`) of each of the columns we wanted to compare. Then, we iterated over that character vector by passing it as the object to the right of the keyword `in`.

At each iteration, we used `paste0()` to create three column names from the character string in `cols`. For example, in the first iteration of the loop, the value of `cols` was `name_first`. The first line of code in the for loop body combined `name_first` with `_1` to make the character string `name_first_1` and save it as an object named `col_1`. The second line of code in the for loop body combined `name_first` with `_2` to make the character string `name_first_2` and save it as an object named `col_2`. And, the third line of code in the for loop body combined `name_first` with `_match` to make the character string `name_first_match` and save it as an object named `new_col`.

This will allow us to use `col_1`, `col_2`, and `new_col` in the code that compares the columns and creates each dummy variable. For example, here is what `people[[col_1]]` looks like at each iteration:

```{r}
cols <- c("name_first", "name_last", "street")

for(i in seq_along(cols)) {
  col_1 <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_1")
  col_2 <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_2")
  print(people[[col_1]])
}
```

It is a vector that matches `people[["name_first_1"]]`, `people[["name_last_1"]]`, and `people[["street_1"]]` respectively. 

And here is what `col_2` looks like at each iteration:

```{r}
cols <- c("name_first", "name_last", "street")

for(i in seq_along(cols)) {
  col_1 <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_1")
  col_2 <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_2")
  print(people[[col_2]])
}
```

Now, we can pass each vector to our `is_match()` function at each iteration like this:

```{r}
cols <- c("name_first", "name_last", "street")

for(i in seq_along(cols)) {
  col_1 <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_1")
  col_2 <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_2")
  print(is_match(people[[col_1]], people[[col_2]]))
}
```

These logical vectors are the results we want to go into our new dummy variables. Therefore, the last step is to assign each logical vector above to a new variable in our data frame called `people[["name_first_match"]]`, `people[["name_last_match"]]`, and `people[["street_match"]]` respectively. We do so by allowing `people[[new_col]]` to represent those values at each iteration of the loop:

```{r}
cols <- c("name_first", "name_last", "street")

for(i in seq_along(cols)) {
  col_1   <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_1")
  col_2   <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_2")
  new_col <- paste0(cols[[i]], "_match")
  people[[new_col]] <- is_match(people[[col_1]], people[[col_2]])
}
```

And here is our result:

```{r}
people %>% 
  select(id_1, starts_with("name_f"), starts_with("name_l"), starts_with("s"))
```

In the code above, we used roughly the same amount of code to complete the task with a loop that we used to complete it without a loop. However, this code still has some advantages. We only typed "name_first", "name_last", and "street" once at the beginning of the code chunk. Therefore, we didn't have to worry about forgetting to change a column name after copying and pasting code. Additionally, if we later decide that we also want to compare other columns (e.g., middle name, birth date, city, state, zip code), we only have to update the code in one place -- where we create the `cols` vector. 

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(people, people_1, people_2, col_1, col_2, i, new_col, is_match)
```

## Using for loops for analysis

For our final example of this chapter, let's return to the final example from the [column-wise operations chapter](../dplyr_column_wise/dplyr_column_wise.qmd#across-with-summarise). We started with some simulated study data:

```{r}
study <- tibble(
  age       = c(32, 30, 32, 29, 24, 38, 25, 24, 48, 29, 22, 29, 24, 28, 24, 25, 
                25, 22, 25, 24, 25, 24, 23, 24, 31, 24, 29, 24, 22, 23, 26, 23, 
                24, 25, 24, 33, 27, 25, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 27, 24, 43, 25, 24, 
                27, 28, 29, 24, 26, 28, 25, 24, 26, 24, 26, 31, 24, 26, 31, 34, 
                26, 25, 27, NA),
  age_group = c(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
                1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
                1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 
                2, 1, 1, 1, NA),
  gender    = c(2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 
                1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 
                1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 
                1, 1, 2, 1, NA),
  ht_in     = c(70, 63, 62, 67, 67, 58, 64, 69, 65, 68, 63, 68, 69, 66, 67, 65, 
                64, 75, 67, 63, 60, 67, 64, 73, 62, 69, 67, 62, 68, 66, 66, 62,

                61, 69, 66, NA),
  wt_lbs    = c(216, 106, 145, 195, 143, 125, 138, 140, 158, 167, 145, 297, 146, 
                125, 111, 125, 130, 182, 170, 121, 98, 150, 132, 250, 137, 124,

                163, 141, NA),
  bmi       = c(30.99, 18.78, 26.52, 30.54, 22.39, 26.12, 23.69, 20.67, 26.29, 
                25.39, 25.68, 45.15, 21.56, 20.17, 17.38, 20.8, 22.31, 22.75, 
                26.62, 21.43, 19.14, 23.49, 22.66, 32.98, 25.05, 18.31, 29.13, 
                27.07, 20.37, 25.01, 19.69, 25.97, 18.88, 20.07, NA, 26.76, 
                26.97, 25.24, 20.68, 23.72, 24.82, 23.62, 18.65, 24.03, 23.86, 
                10.63, 23.02, 23.72, 20.82, 28.24, NA, 37.55, 18.88, 18.3, 
                19.13, 21.48, 22.59, 24.96, 21.63, NA, 29.35, 21.76, 17.97, 
                22.31, 19.27, 24.07, 22.76, NA),
  bmi_3cat  = c(3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 
                1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, NA, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
                1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, NA, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA, 2, 1, 
                1, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA)
) %>% 
  mutate(
    age_group = factor(age_group, labels = c("Younger than 30", "30 and Older")),
    gender    = factor(gender, labels = c("Female", "Male")),
    bmi_3cat  = factor(bmi_3cat, labels = c("Normal", "Overweight", "Obese"))
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

Then we saw how to use `across()` with `pivot_longer()` to remove repetition and get our results into a format that were easier to read an interpret: 

```{r}
summary_stats <- study %>% 
  summarise(
    across(
      .cols  = c(age, ht_in, wt_lbs, bmi),
      .fns   = list(
        n_miss = ~ sum(is.na(.x)),
        mean   = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
        median = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
        min    = ~ min(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
        max    = ~ max(.x, na.rm = TRUE)
      ),
      .names = "{col}-{fn}" # This is the new part of the code
    ) 
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

```{r}
summary_stats %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols      = everything(),
    names_to  = c("characteristic", ".value"),
    names_sep = "-"
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(summary_stats)
```

I think that method works really nicely for our continuous variables; however, the situation is slightly more complicated for categorical variables. To illustrate the problem as simply as possible, let's start by just getting counts for each of our categorical variables: 

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(age_group)
```

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(gender)
```

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(bmi_3cat)
```

You are, of course, and old pro at this by now, and you quickly spot all the unnecessary repetition. So, you decide to pass `count` to the `.fns` argument like this:

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
study %>% 
  summarise(
    across(
      .cols = c(age_group, gender, bmi_3cat),
      .fns  = count
    )
  )
```

Unfortunately, this won't work. At least not currently. There are a couple reasons why this won't work, but the one that is probably easiest to wrap your head around is related to the number of results produced by `count()`. What does this mean? Well, when we pass each continuous variable to `mean()` (or `median`, `min`, or `max`) we get _one_ result back for each column:

```{r}
study %>% 
  summarise(
    across(
      .cols = c(age, ht_in),
      .fns  = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  )
```

It's easy for `dplyr` to arrange those results into a data frame. However, the results from `count()` are much less predictable. For example, `study %>% count(age_group)` had three results, `study %>% count(gender)` had three results, and `study %>% count(bmi_3cat)` had four results. Also, remember that every column of a data frame has to have the same number of rows. So, if the code we used to try to pass `count` to the `.fns` argument above would actually run, it might look something like this:

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-summarise
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Representation of result from the above code if it could be run successfully
knitr::include_graphics("summarise.png")
```

Because `summarise()` lays the results out side-by-side, it's not clear what would go into the 4 cells in the bottom-left corner of the results data frame. Therefore, it isn't necessarily straightforward for `dplyr` to figure out how it should return such results to us.

However, when we use a for loop, _we can create our own structure_ to hold the results. And, that structure can be pretty much any structure that meets our needs. In this case, one option would be to create a data frame to hold our categorical counts that looks like this:

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-our-structure-1
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Empty data frame structure to hold for loop results 
knitr::include_graphics("our_structure_1.png")
```

Then, we can use a for loop to fill in the empty data frame so that we end up with results that look like this:

```{r}
#| label: writing-for-loops-our-structure-2
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Data frame structure with for loop results 
knitr::include_graphics("our_structure_2.png")
```

The process for getting to our finished product is a little bit involved (and probably a little intimidating for some of you) and will require us to cover a couple new topics. So, we'll start by giving you the complete code for accomplishing this task. Then, we'll pick the code apart, piece-by-piece, to make sure we understand _how_ it works.

Here is the complete solution:

```{r}
# Structure 1. An object to contain the results.
  # Create the data frame structure that will contain our results
cat_table <- tibble(
  variable = vector("character"), 
  category = vector("character"), 
  n        = vector("numeric")
) 

# Structure 2. The actual for loop.
  # For each column, get the column name, category names, and count.
  # Then, add them to the bottom of the results data frame we created above.
for(i in c("age_group", "gender", "bmi_3cat")) {
  cat_stats <- study %>% 
    count(.data[[i]]) %>% # Use .data to refer to the current data frame.
    mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% # Use . to refer to the result to this point.
    rename(category = 1)
  
  # Here is where we update cat_table with the results for each column
  cat_table <- bind_rows(cat_table, cat_stats)
}
```

```{r}
cat_table
```

We'll use the rest of this chapter section to walk through the code above and make sure we understand how it works. For starters, we will create our results data frame structure like this:

```{r}
cat_table <- tibble(
  variable = vector("character"), 
  category = vector("character"), 
  n        = vector("numeric")
) 
```

```{r}
str(cat_table)
```

As you can see, we created an empty data frame with three columns. One to hold the variable names, one to hold the variable categories, and one to hold the count of occurrences of each category. Now, we can use a for loop to iteratively add results to our empty data frame structure. This works similarly to the way we added mean values to the `xyz_means` vector in the first example above. As a reminder, here is what the for loop code looks like:

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
for(i in c("age_group", "gender", "bmi_3cat")) {
  cat_stats <- study %>% 
    count(.data[[i]]) %>%
    mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>%
    rename(category = 1)
  
  cat_table <- bind_rows(cat_table, cat_stats)
}
```

For our next step, let's walk through the first little chunk of code inside the for loop body. Specifically:

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(.data[[i]]) %>%
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>%
  rename(category = 1)
```

If we were using this code to analyze a single variable, as opposed to using it in a for loop, this is what the result would look like:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(age_group) %>%
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>%
  rename(category = 1) %>% 
  print()
```

We've already seen what the `study %>% count(age_group)` part of the code does, and we already know that we can use `mutate()` to create a new column in our data frame. In this case, the name of the new column is `variable`. But, you may be wondering what the `names(.)[1]` after the equal sign does. Let's take a look. Here, we can see the data frame that is getting passed to `mutate()`:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(age_group) %>% 
  print()
```

It's a data frame with two columns. The first column actually has two different kinds of information that we need. It contains the name of the variable being analyzed as the column name, and it contains all the categories of that variable as the column values. We want to separate those two pieces of information into two columns. This task is similar to some of the "tidy data" tasks we worked through in the [chapter on restructuring data frames](../restructuring_data_frames/restructuring_data_frames.qmd#tidy-data). In fact, we can also use `pivot_longer()` to get the result we want:

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(age_group) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols      = "age_group",
    names_to  = "variable",
    values_to = "category"
  )
```

In this solution for this task, however, we're not going to use `pivot_longer()` for a couple of reasons. First, it's an opportunity for us to learn about the special use of dot (`.`) inside of `dplyr` verbs. Second, this solution will use `dplyr` only. It will not require us to use the `tidyr` package. 

Before we talk about the dot, however, let's make sure we know what the `names()[1]` is doing. There aren't any new concepts here, but we may not have used them this way before. The `name()` function just returns a character vector containing the column names of the data frame we pass to it. So, when we pass the `cat_stats` data frame to it, this is what it returns:

```{r}
names(cat_stats)
```

We want to use the first value, `"age_group"` to fill-in our the new `variable` column we want to create. We can use bracket notation to subset the first element of the character vector of column names above like this:

```{r}
names(cat_stats)[1]
```

What does the dot do? Well, outside of our `dplyr` pipeline, it doesn't do anything useful:

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
names(.)[1]
```

_Inside_ of our `dplyr` pipeline, you can think of it as a placeholder for whatever is getting passed to the `dplyr` verb -- `mutate()` in this case. So, what is getting passed to mutate? The result of everything that comes before `mutate()` in the pipeline. And what does that result look like in this case? It looks like this:

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(age_group)
```

So, we can use the dot inside of mutate as a substitute for the results data frame getting passed to `mutate()`. Said another way. To `dplyr`, this:

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
names(study %>% count(age_group))
```

and this:

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
study %>% count(age_group) %>% names(.)
```

are the exact same thing in this context:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(age_group) %>%
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>%
  print()
```

Now, we have all the variables we wanted for our final results table. Keep in mind, however, that we will eventually be stacking similar results from our other variables (i.e., `gender` and `bmi_3cat`) below these results using `bind_rows()`. You may remember from the [chapter on working with multiple data frames](../multiple_data_frames/multiple_data_frames.qmd#combining-data-frames-vertically-adding-rows) that the `bind_rows()` function matches columns together by _name_, not by position. So, we need to change the `age_group` column name to `category`. If we don't, we will end up with something that looks like this:

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(age_group) %>% 
  bind_rows(study %>% count(gender))
```

Not what we want, right? Again, if we were doing this analysis one variable at a time, our code might look like this:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(age_group) %>% 
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
  rename(category = age_group) %>% 
  print()
```

We used the `rename()` function above to change the name of the first column from `age_group` to `category`. Remember, the syntax for renaming columns with the `rename()` function is `new_name = old_name`. But, inside our for loop we will actually have 3 old names, right? In the first iteration `old_name` will be `age_group`, in the second iteration `old_name` will be `gender`, and in the third iteration `old_name` will be `bmi_cat`. We could loop over the names, but there's an even easier solution. Instead of asking `rename()` to rename our column by name using this syntax, `new_name = old_name`, we can also ask `rename()` to rename our column by _position_ using this syntax, `new_name = column_number`. So, in our example above, we could get the same result by replacing `age_group` with `1` because `age_group` is the first column in the data frame:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(age_group) %>% 
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
  rename(category = 1) %>% # Replace age_group with 1
  print()
```

And, using this method, we don't have to make any changes to the value being passed to `rename()` when we are analyzing our other variables. For example:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(gender) %>% # Changed the column from age_group to gender
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
  rename(category = 1) %>% # Still have 1 here
  print()
```

At this point, we have all the elements we need manually create the data frame of final results we want. First, we create the empty results table:

```{r}
cat_table <- tibble(
  variable = vector("character"), 
  category = vector("character"), 
  n        = vector("numeric")
) %>%
  print()
```

Then, we get the data frame of results for `age_group`:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(age_group) %>%
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
  rename(category = 1) %>% 
  print()
```

Then, we use `bind_rows()` to add those results to our `cat_table` data frame:

```{r}
cat_table <- cat_table %>% 
  bind_rows(cat_stats) %>% 
  print()
```

Then, we copy and paste the last two steps above, replacing `age_group` with `gender`:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(gender) %>% # Change to gender
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
  rename(category = 1)

cat_table <- cat_table %>% 
  bind_rows(cat_stats) %>% 
  print()
```

Then, we copy and paste the two steps above, replacing `gender` with `bmi_3cat`:

```{r}
cat_stats <- study %>% 
  count(bmi_3cat) %>%  # Change to bmi_3cat
  mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
  rename(category = 1)

cat_table <- cat_table %>% 
  bind_rows(cat_stats) %>% 
  print()
```

That is exactly the final result we wanted, and you might have noticed that the only elements of the code chunks above that changed were the column names being passed to `count()`. If we can just figure out how to loop over the column names, then we can remove a ton of unnecessary repetition from our code. Our first attempt might look like this:

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
for(i in c(age_group, gender, bmi_3cat)) {
  study %>% 
    count(i) %>% 
    mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
    rename(category = 1)
}
```

However, it doesn't work. In the code above, R is looking for and _object_ in the global environment called `age_group`. Of course, there is no object in the global environment named `age_group`. Rather, there is an object in the global environment named `study` that has a column named `age_group`. 

We can get rid of that error by wrapping each column name in quotes:

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
for(i in c("age_group", "gender", "bmi_3cat")) {
  study %>% 
    count(i) %>% 
    mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
    rename(category = 1)
}
```

Unfortunately, that just gives us a different error. In the code above, `count()` is looking for a column named `i` in the `study` data frame. You may be wondering why `i` is not being converted to `"age_group"`, `"gender"`, and `"bmi_3cat"` in the code above. The short answer is that it's because of [tidy evaluation and data masking](../writing_functions/writing_functions.qmd#tidy-evaluation).

So, we need a way to iteratively pass each quoted column name to the `count()` function inside our for loop body, but also let `dplyr` know that they _are column names_, not just random character strings. Fortunately, the `rlang` package (which is partially imported with `dplyr`), provides us with a special construct that can help us solve this problem. It's called the `.data` pronoun. Here's how we can use it:

```{r}
for(i in c("age_group", "gender", "bmi_3cat")) {
  study %>% 
    count(.data[[i]]) %>% 
    mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% 
    rename(category = 1) %>% 
    print()
}
```

Here's how it works. Remember that data masking allows us to write column names directly in `dplyr` code without having to use dollar sign or bracket notation to tell R which data frame that column lives in. For example, in the following code, `dplyr` just "knows" that `age_group` is a column in the `study` data frame:

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(age_group)
```

The same is not true for base R functions. For example, we can't pass `age_group` directly to the `table()` function: 

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
table(age_group)
```

We have to use dollar sign or bracket notation to tell R that `age_group` is a column in `study`:

```{r}
table(study[["age_group"]])
```

This is a really nice feature of `dplyr` when we're using dplyr interactively. But, as we've already discussed, it does present us with some challenges when we use `dplyr` functions inside of the functions we write ourselves and inside of for loops. 

As you can see in the code below, the tidy evaluation essentially blocks the `i` inside of `count()` from being replaced with each of the character strings we are looping over. Instead, `dplyr` looks for a literal `i` as a column name in the `study` data frame.

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
for(i in c("age_group", "gender", "bmi_3cat")) {
  study %>% 
    count(i)
}
```

So, we need a way to tell `dplyr` that `"age_group"` is a column _in_ the `study` data frame. Well, we know how to use quoted column names inside bracket notation. So, we could write code like this:

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(study[["age_group"]])
```

However, the column name (i.e., `study[["age_group"]]`) in the results data frame above isn't ideal to work with. Additionally, the code above isn't very flexible because we have the `study` data frame hard-coded into it (i.e., `study[["age_group"]]`). That's where the `.data` pronoun comes to the rescue:

```{r}
study %>% 
  count(.data[["age_group"]])
```

The `.data` pronoun "is not a data frame; it’s a special construct, a pronoun, that allows you to access the current variables either directly, with .data$x or indirectly with .data[[var]]." @Wickham2020-dx

When we put it all together, our code looks like this:

```{r}
# Create the data frame structure that will contain our results
cat_table <- tibble(
  variable = vector("character"), 
  category = vector("character"), 
  n        = vector("numeric")
) 

# For each column, get the column name, category names, and count.
# Then, add them to the bottom of the results data frame we created above.
for(i in c("age_group", "gender", "bmi_3cat")) {
  cat_stats <- study %>% 
    count(.data[[i]]) %>% # Use .data to refer to the current data frame.
    mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% # Use . to refer to the current data frame.
    rename(category = 1)
  
  # Here is where we update cat_table with the results for each column
  cat_table <- bind_rows(cat_table, cat_stats)
}
```

```{r}
cat_table
```

And, we can do other interesting things with our results now that we have it in this format. For example, we can easily add percentages along with our counts like this:

```{r}
cat_table %>% 
  group_by(variable) %>% 
  mutate(
    percent = n / sum(n) * 100
  )
```

Finally, we could also write our own function that uses the code above. That way, we can easily reuse this code in the future:

```{r}
cat_stats <- function(data, ...) {
  # Create the data frame structure that will contain our results
  cat_table <- tibble(
    variable = vector("character"), 
    category = vector("character"), 
    n        = vector("numeric")
  ) 
  
  # For each column in ..., get the column name, category names, and count.
  # Then, add them to the bottom of the results data frame we created above.
  for(i in c(...)) {
    stats <- data %>% 
      count(.data[[i]]) %>% # Use .data to refer to the current data frame.
      mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% # Use . to refer to the current data frame.
      rename(category = 1)
    
    # Here is where we update cat_table with the results for each column
    cat_table <- bind_rows(cat_table, stats)
  }
  # Return results
  cat_table
}
```

```{r}
cat_stats(study, "age_group", "gender", "bmi_3cat")
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
rm(list = ls())
```

We covered a lot of material in this chapter. For loops tend to be confusing for people who are just learning to program. When you throw in the tidy evaluation stuff, it can be really confusing -- even for experienced R programmers. So, if you are still feeling a little confused, don't beat yourself up. Also, trying to memorize everything we covered in this chapter is not recommended. Instead, we recommend that you read it until you have understood what for loops are and when they might be useful at a high level. Then, refer back to this chapter (or other online references that discuss for loops) if you find yourself in a situation where you believe that for loops might be the right tool to help you complete a given programming task. Having said that, also keep in mind that for loops are rarely the _only_ tool you will have at your disposal to complete the task. In the next chapter, we will learn how to use functionals, specifically the `purrr` package, in place of for loops. You may find this approach to iteration more intuitive.
