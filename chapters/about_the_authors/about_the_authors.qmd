[Dr. Livingston's Faculty Profile](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=melvin-livingston-8970)

Dr. Livingston is a methodologist with expertise in the the application of quasi-experimental design principals to the evaluation for both community interventions and state policies. He has particular expertise in time series modeling, mixed effects modeling, econometric methods, and power analysis. As part of his work involving community trials, he has been the statistician on the long term follow-up study of a school based cluster randomized trial in low-income communities with a focus on explaining the etiology of risky alcohol, drug, and sexual behaviors. Additionally, he was the statistician for a longitudinal study examining the etiology of alcohol use among racially diverse and economically disadvantaged urban youth, and co-investigator for a NIAAA- and NIDA-funded trial to prevent alcohol use and alcohol-related problems among youth living in high-risk, low-income communities within the Cherokee Nation. Prevention work at the community level led him to an interest in the impact of state and federal socioeconomic policies on health outcomes. He is a Co-Investigator of a 50-state, 30-year study of effects of state-level economic and education policies on a diverse set of public health outcomes, explicitly examining differential effects across disadvantaged subgroups of the population.

His current research interests center around the application of quasi-experimental design and econometric methods to the evaluation of the health effects of state and federal policy.
