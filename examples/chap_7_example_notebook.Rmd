# Load packages and data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
data("mtcars")
```

```{r}
# I'm not sure what's in the mtcars data. I'm printing it below to take a look
print(mtcars)
```

# Data analysis

Below, we calculate the average mpg across all cars in the mtcars data frame.

```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

Here, we also plot mpg against displacement.

```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
```
