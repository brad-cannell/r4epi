Welcome to R for Epidemiology! 

This electronic textbook was originally created to accompany the Introduction to R Programming for Epidemiologic Research course at the [University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health](https://sph.uth.edu/). However, we hope it will be useful to anyone who is interested in R, epidemiology, or human health and well-being.

## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

This book is currently a work in progress (and probably always will be); however, there are already many people who have played an important role (some unknowingly) in helping develop it thus far. First, we’d like to offer our gratitude to all past, current, and future members of the R Core Team for maintaining this _amazing_, _free_ software. We’d also like to express our gratitude to everyone at [Posit](https://posit.co/). You are also developing and _giving away_ some amazing software. In particular, we’d like to acknowledge [Garrett Grolemund](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrett-grolemund-49328411/) and [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/). Both have had a huge impact on how we use and teach R. We’d also like to thank our students for all the feedback they’ve given us while taking our courses. In particular, we want to thank [Jared Wiegand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-wiegand/) and Yiqun Wang for their many edits and suggestions. 

This electronic textbook was created and published using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
