This `|>` is the pipe operator. As of version 4.1, the pipe operator is part of base R. Prior to version 4.1, the pipe operator was only available from the [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/). The pipe imported from the `magrittr` package looked like `%>%` and you may still come across it in R code -- including in this book.\n\nü§î What does the pipe operator do? In our opinion, the pipe operator makes your R code _much_ easier to read and understand. \n\nü§î How does it do that? It makes your R code easier to read and understand by allowing you to view your nested functions in the order you want them to execute, as opposed to viewing them literally nested inside of each other.\n\nYou were first introduced to nesting functions in the [Let's get programming chapter](#nesting-functions). Recall that functions return values, and the R language allows us to directly pass those returned values into other functions for further calculations. We referred to this as [nesting functions](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-nesting-functions) and said it was a big deal because it allows us to do very complex operations in a scalable way, without storing a bunch of unneeded intermediate objects in our global environment.\n\nIn that chapter, we also discussed a potential downside of nesting functions. Namely, our R code can become really difficult to read when we start nesting lots of functions inside one another. \n\nPipes allow us to retain the benefits of nesting functions without making our code really difficult to read. At this point, we think it's best to show you an example. In the code below we want to generate a sequence of numbers, then we want to calculate the log of each of the numbers, and then find the mean of the logged values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Performing an operation using a series of steps.\nmy_numbers <- seq(from = 2, to = 100, by = 2)\nmy_numbers_logged <- log(my_numbers)\nmean_my_numbers_logged <- mean(my_numbers_logged)\nmean_my_numbers_logged\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.662703\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëÜ **Here's what we did above:**\n\n* We created a vector of numbers called `my_numbers` using the `seq()` function.   \n* Then we used the `log()` function to create a new vector of numbers called `my_numbers_logged`, which contains the log values of the numbers in `my_numbers`.   \n* Then we used the `mean()` function to create a new vector called `mean_my_numbers_logged`, which contains the mean of the log values in `my_numbers_logged`.    \n* Finally, we printed the value of `mean_my_numbers_logged` to the screen to view.\n\nThe obvious first question here is, \"why would I ever want to do that?\" Good question! You probably won't ever want to do what we just did in the code chunk above, but we haven't learned many functions for working with real data yet and we don't want to distract you with a bunch of new functions right now. Instead, we want to demonstrate what pipes do. So, we're stuck with this silly example.\n\nüëç What's nice about the code above? We would argue that it is pretty easy to read because each line does one thing and it follows a series of steps in logical order. First, create the numbers. Second, log the numbers. Third, get the mean of the logged numbers.\n\nüëé What could be better about the code above? All we really wanted was the mean value of the logged numbers (i.e., `mean_my_numbers_logged`); however, on our way to getting `mean_my_numbers_logged` we also created two other objects that we don't care about -- `my_numbers` and `my_numbers_logged`. It took us time to do the extra typing required to create those objects, and those objects are now cluttering up our global environment. It may not seem like that big of a deal here, but in a real data analysis project these things can really add up.\n\nNext, let's try nesting these functions instead:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Performing an operation using nested functions.\nmean_my_numbers_logged <- mean(log(seq(from = 2, to = 100, by = 2)))\nmean_my_numbers_logged\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.662703\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëÜ**Here's what we did above:**\n\n* We created a vector of numbers called `mean_my_numbers_logged` by nesting the `seq()` function inside of the `log()` function and nesting the `log()` function inside of the `mean()` function.   \n\n* Then, we printed the value of `mean_my_numbers_logged` to the screen to view.\n\nüëç What's nice about the code above? It is certainly more efficient than the sequential step method we used at first. We went from using 4 lines of code to using 2 lines of code, and we didn't generate any unneeded objects.\n\nüëé What could be better about the code above? Many people would say that this code is harder to read than than the the sequential step method we used at first. This is primarily due to the fact that each line no longer does one thing, and the code no longer follows a sequence of steps from start to finish. For example, the final operation we want to do is calculate the mean, but the `mean()` function is the first function we see when we read the code. \n\nFinally, let's try see what this code looks like when we use pipes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Performing an operation using pipes.\nmean_my_numbers_logged <- seq(from = 2, to = 100, by = 2) |> \n  log() |> \n  mean()\nmean_my_numbers_logged\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.662703\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëÜ**Here's what we did above:**\n\n* We created a vector of numbers called `mean_my_numbers_logged` by passing the result of the `seq()` function directly to the `log()` function using the pipe operator, and passing the result of the the `log()` function directly to the `mean()` function using the pipe operator.   \n\n* Then, we printed the value of `mean_my_numbers_logged` to the screen to view.\n\nüëè As you can see, by using pipes we were able to retain the benefits of performing the operation in a series of steps (i.e., each line of code does one thing and they follow in sequential order) and the benefits of nesting functions (i.e., more efficient code).\n\nThe utility of the pipe operator may not be immediately apparent to you based on this very simple example. So, next we're going to show you a little snippet of code from one of our research projects. In the code chunk that follows, the operation we're trying to perform on the data is written in two different ways -- without pipes and with pipes. It's very unlikely that you will know what this code does, but that isn't really the point. Just try to get a sense of which version is easier for you to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Nest functions without pipes\nresponses <- select(ungroup(filter(group_by(filter(merged_data, !is.na(incident_number)), incident_number), row_number() == 1)), date_entered, detect_data, validation)\n\n# Nest functions with pipes\nresponses <- merged_data |> \n  filter(!is.na(incident_number)) |> \n  group_by(incident_number) |> \n  filter(row_number() == 1) |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  select(date_entered, detect_data, validation)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Even without knowing what this code does, do you feel like one version is easier to read than the other?\n\n## How do pipes work?\n\nPerhaps we've convinced you that pipes are generally useful. But, it may not be totally obvious to you _how_ to use them. They are actually really simple. Start by thinking about pipes as having a left side and a right side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pipes have a left side and a right side.](left_right.png){#fig-left-right width=900}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing on the right side of the pipe operator should always be a function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A function should always be to the right of the pipe operator.](right_side.png){#fig-right-side width=900}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing on the left side of the pipe operator can be a function or an object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A function or an object can be to the left of the pipe operator.](left_side.png){#fig-left-side width=900}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the pipe operator does is take the thing on the left side and pass it to the first argument of the function on the right side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pipe the left side to the first argument of the function on the right side.](pipe.png){#fig-pipe width=900}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a really simple concept, but it can also cause people a lot of confusion at first. So, let's take look at a couple more concrete examples.\n\nBelow we pass a vector of numbers to the to the `mean()` function, which returns the mean value of those numbers to us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(c(2, 4, 6, 8))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use a pipe to pass that vector of numbers to the `mean()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(2, 4, 6, 8) |> mean()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the R interpreter took the thing on the left side of the pipe operator, stuck it into the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe operator, and then executed the function. In this case, the `mean()` function doesn't require any other arguments, so we don't have to write anything else inside of the `mean()` function's parentheses. When we see `c(2, 4, 6, 8) |> mean()`, R sees `mean(c(2, 4, 6, 8))`\n\nHere's one more example. Pretty soon we will learn how to use the `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package to keep only a subset of rows from our data frame. Let's start by simulating some data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulate some data\nheight_and_weight <- tibble(\n  id     = c(\"001\", \"002\", \"003\", \"004\", \"005\"),\n  sex    = c(\"Male\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Male\"),\n  ht_in  = c(71, 69, 64, 65, 73),\n  wt_lbs = c(190, 176, 130, 154, 173)\n)\n\nheight_and_weight\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 4\n  id    sex    ht_in wt_lbs\n  <chr> <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 001   Male      71    190\n2 002   Male      69    176\n3 003   Female    64    130\n4 004   Female    65    154\n5 005   Male      73    173\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to work, the `filter()` function requires us to pass two values to it. The first value is the name of the data frame object with the rows we want to subset. The second is the condition used to subset the rows. Let's say that we want to do a subgroup analysis using only the females in our data frame. We could use the `filter()` function like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# First value = data frame name (height_and_weight)\n# Second value = condition for keeping rows (when the value of sex is Female)\nfilter(height_and_weight, sex == \"Female\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 √ó 4\n  id    sex    ht_in wt_lbs\n  <chr> <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 003   Female    64    130\n2 004   Female    65    154\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüëÜ**Here's what we did above:**\n\n* We kept only the rows from the data frame called `height_and_weight` that had a value of `Female` for the variable called `sex` using `dplyr`'s `filter()` function.    \n\nWe can also use a pipe to pass the `height_and_weight` data frame to the `filter()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# First value = data frame name (height_and_weight)\n# Second value = condition for keeping rows (when the value of sex is Female)\nheight_and_weight |> filter(sex == \"Female\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 √ó 4\n  id    sex    ht_in wt_lbs\n  <chr> <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 003   Female    64    130\n2 004   Female    65    154\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we get the exact same result. So, the R interpreter took the thing on the left side of the pipe operator, stuck it into the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe operator, and then executed the function. In this case, the `filter()` function needs a value supplied to two arguments in order to work. So, we wrote `sex == \"Female\"` inside of the `filter()` function's parentheses. When we see `height_and_weight |> filter(sex == \"Female\")`, R sees `filter(height_and_weight, sex == \"Female\")`.\n\n::: callout-note\nüóí**Side Note:** This pattern -- a data frame piped into a function, which is usually then piped into one or more additional functions is something that you will see over and over in this book.\n:::\n\nDon't worry too much about how the `filter()` function works. That isn't the point here. The two main takeaways so far are:\n\n1. Pipes make your code easier to read once you get used to them.   \n\n2. The R interpreter knows how to automatically take whatever is on the left side of the pipe operator and make it the value that gets passed to the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe operator.   \n\n### Keyboard shortcut\n\nTyping `|>` over and over can be tedious! Thankfully, RStudio provides a keyboard shortcut for inserting the pipe operator into your R code.\n\nOn Mac type `shift + command + m`.\n\nOn Windows type `shift + control + m`\n\nIt may not seem totally intuitive at first, but this shortcut is really handy once you get used to it.\n\n### Pipe style\n\nAs with all the code we write, style is an important consideration. We generally agree with the recommendations given in the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html). In particular: \n\n1. We tend to use pipes in such a way that each line of code does one, and only one, thing.\n\n2. If a line of code contains a pipe operator, the pipe operator should generally be the last thing typed on the line.\n\n3. The pipe operator should always have a space in front of it. \n\n4. If the pipe operator isn't the last thing typed on the line, then it should be have a space after it too.\n\n5. \"If the function you‚Äôre piping into has named arguments (like `mutate()` or `summarize()`), put each argument on a new line. If the function doesn‚Äôt have named arguments (like `select()` or `filter()`), keep everything on one line unless it doesn‚Äôt fit, in which case you should put each argument on its own line.\" @Wickham2023-ta\n\n6. \"After the first step of the pipeline, indent each line by two spaces. RStudio will automatically put the spaces in for you after a line break following a `|>` . If you‚Äôre putting each argument on its own line, indent by an extra two spaces. Make sure `)` is on its own line, and un-indented to match the horizontal position of the function name.\" @Wickham2023-ta\n\nEach of these recommendations are demonstrated in the code below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Do this...\nfemale_height_and_weight <- height_and_weight |> # Line 1\n  filter(sex == \"Female\") |>                     # Line 2\n  summarise(                                     # Line 3\n    mean_ht = mean(ht_in),                       # Line 4\n    sd_ht   = sd(ht_in)                          # Line 5\n  ) |>                                           # Line 6\n  print()                                        # Line 7\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 2\n  mean_ht sd_ht\n    <dbl> <dbl>\n1    64.5 0.707\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code above, we would first like you to notice that each line of code does one, and only one, thing. Line 1 _only_ assigns the result of the code pipeline to a new object -- `female_height_and_weight`, line 2 _only_ keeps the rows in the data frame we want -- rows for females, line 3 _only_ opens the `summarise()` function, line 4 _only_ calculates the mean of the `ht_in` column, line 5 _only_ calculates the standard deviation of the `ht_in` column, line 6 _only_ closes the `summarise()` function, and line 7 _only_ prints the result to the screen. \n\nSecond, we'd like you to notice that each line containing a pipe operator (i.e., lines 1, 2, and 6) _ends_ with the pipe operator, and the pipe operators all have a space in front of them.\n\nThird, we'd like you to notice that each named argument in the `summarise()` function is written on its own line (i.e., lines 4 and 5). \n\nFinally, we'd like you notice that each step of the pipeline is indented two spaces (i.e., lines 2, 3, 6, and 7), lines 4 and 5 are indented an _additional_ two spaces because they contain named arguments to the `summarise()` function, and that the `summarise()` function's closing parenthesis is on its own line (i.e., line 6), horizontally aligned with the \"s\" in \"summarise(\". \n\nNow compare that with the code in the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Avoid this...\nfemale_height_and_weight <- height_and_weight |> filter(sex == \"Female\") |> \n  summarise(mean_ht = mean(ht_in), sd_ht = sd(ht_in)) |> print()  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 2\n  mean_ht sd_ht\n    <dbl> <dbl>\n1    64.5 0.707\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we get the same result as before, most people would agree that the code is harder to quickly glance at and read. Further, most people would also agree that it would be more difficult to add or rearrange steps when the code is written that way. As previously stated, there is a certain amount of subjectivity in what constitutes \"good\" style. But, we will once again reiterate that it is important to adopt _some_ style and use it consistently. If you are a beginning R programmer, why not adopt the tried-and-true styles suggested here and adjust later if you have a compelling reason to do so?\n\n## Final thought on pipes\n\nWe think it's important to note that not everyone in the R programming community is a fan of using pipes. We hope that we've made a compelling case for why we use pipes, but we acknowledge that it is ultimately a preference, and that using pipes is not the best choice in all circumstances. Whether or not you choose to use the pipe operator is up to you; however, we will be using them extensively throughout the remainder of this book.\n",
