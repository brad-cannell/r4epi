For the purposes of this chapter, however, we are going to focus on using the `purrr::map` functions as an alternative approach to removing unnecessary repetition from the various different code chunks we've already seen in other chapters. \n\nFor our purposes, you can think of the `purrr::map` functions as a replacement for for loops. In other words, you can think of them as _doing_ the same thing as a for loop, but writing the code in a different way. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nWe also want to mention that the `purrr` package is closely related to base R's `apply` functions (i.e., `apply()`, `lapply()`, `sapply()`, `tapply()`). We aren't going to discuss those functions any further, but you will often see them mentioned side-by-side as solutions to a given coding challenge on websites like Stack Overflow. The `purrr` package is partially meant to be an improved replacement for the `apply` functions.\n:::\n\nAs usual, let's start by taking a look at a simple example -- the same one we used to start the [chapter on column-wise operations](#column-wise-operations-in-dplyr) and the [chapter on writing for loops](#writing-for-loops). Afterwards, we will compare the basic structure of `purrr::map` functions to the basic structure of for loops. Finally, we will work through a number of the examples we've already worked through in this part of the book using the `purrr` approach.\n\nAt this point, we will go ahead and load `dplyr` and `purrr` and simulate our data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\ndf_xyz <- tibble(\n  x = rnorm(10),\n  y = rnorm(10),\n  z = rnorm(10)\n) %>% \n  print()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n         x      y      z\n     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 -0.560   1.22  -1.07 \n 2 -0.230   0.360 -0.218\n 3  1.56    0.401 -1.03 \n 4  0.0705  0.111 -0.729\n 5  0.129  -0.556 -0.625\n 6  1.72    1.79  -1.69 \n 7  0.461   0.498  0.838\n 8 -1.27   -1.97   0.153\n 9 -0.687   0.701 -1.14 \n10 -0.446  -0.473  1.25 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the [chapter on column-wise operations](#column-wise-operations-in-dplyr) we used `dplyr`'s `across()` function to efficiently find the mean of each column in the `df_xyz` data frame:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_xyz %>%\n  summarise(\n    across(\n      .cols  = everything(),\n      .fns   = mean,\n      .names = \"{col}_mean\"\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\n  x_mean y_mean z_mean\n   <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 0.0746  0.209 -0.425\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the [chapter on writing for loops](#writing-for-loops), we learned an alternative approach that would also work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxyz_means <- vector(\"double\", ncol(df_xyz))\n\nfor(i in seq_along(df_xyz)) {\n  xyz_means[[i]] <- mean(df_xyz[[i]])\n}\n\nxyz_means\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  0.07462564  0.20862196 -0.42455887\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative way to complete the analysis above is with the `map_dbl()` function from the `purrr` package like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxyz_means <- map_dbl(\n  .x = df_xyz, \n  .f = mean\n) \n\nxyz_means\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          x           y           z \n 0.07462564  0.20862196 -0.42455887 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nðŸ‘†**Here's what we did above:**\n\n* We used `purr`'s `map_dbl()` function to iteratively calculate the mean of each column in the `df_xyz` data frame. There are other `map` functions beside `map_dbl()`. We will eventually discuss them all.\n\n* You can type `?purrr::map_dbl` into your R console to view the help documentation for this function and follow along with the explanation below.\n\n* The first argument to all of the `map` functions is the `.x` argument. You should pass the name of a list, data frame, or vector that you want to iterate over to the `.x` argument. If the object passed to the `.x` argument is a vector, then `map` will apply the function passed to the `.f` argument (see below) to each element of the vector. If the object passed to the `.x` argument is a data frame, then `map` will apply the function passed to the `.f` argument to each column of the data frame. Above, we passed the `df_xyz` data frame to the `.x`.\n\n* The second argument to all of the `map` functions is the `.f` argument. You should pass the name of function, or functions, you want to apply iteratively to the object you passed to the `.x` argument. In the example above, we passed the mean function to the `.f` argument. Notice that we typed `mean` without the parentheses.\n\n* The third argument to all of the `map` functions is the `...` argument. In this case, the `...` argument is where we pass any additional arguments to the function we passed to the `.f` argument. For example, we passed the `mean` function to the `.f` argument above. If the data frame above had missing values, we could have passed `na.rm = TRUE` to the `mean()` function using the `...` argument. We saw a similar [example of this when we were learning about `across()`](#the-across-function).\n\nAs you can see, using the `map_dbl()` package requires far less code than the for loop did, which has at least two potential advantages. First, it's less typing, which means less opportunity for typos. Second, many people in the R community feel as though this _functional_ (i.e., use of a function) approach to iteration is much easier to read and understand than the traditional for loop approach. \n\nAdditionally, you may have also noticed that we were able to assign the returned results of `map_dbl(df_xyz, mean)` to an object in our global environment in the usual way (i.e., with the assignment arrow). This eliminates the need for creating a structure to hold our results ahead of time as we had to do with the for loop. \n\nFinally, when we use `map_dbl()` there isn't a leftover index variable (i.e., `i`) floating around our global environment the way there was when we were writing for loops.\n\nFor those reasons, and possibly others, it's been an observation that the majority of R users prefer the functional approach to iteration -- either `purrr` or the `apply` functions -- over using for loops in most situations.\n\nHowever, some of you reading this text book might have had their first experiences with programming in a language other than R that relied more heavily on for loops. For this reason, you might tend to think first in terms of a for loop and then mentally convert the for loop to a `map` function before writing your code. Therefore, the next section is going to compare and contrast the _basic_ for loop with the `map` functions. You may find this section instructive or interesting even if you aren't someone who first learned iteration using for loops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comparing for loops and the map functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparing for loops and map functions](compare.png){width=6in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will compare for loops and the `purrr::map` functions using the example from the beginning of the chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparing for loops and map functions using example](compare_for_map.png){width=6in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's probably obvious to you at this point, but when using `purrr::map` instead of a for loop, we will be using one of the `map` functions instead of the `for()` function. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Assigning the results of map function to object](compare_assign.png){width=6in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, as previously discussed above, we are able to assign the returned results of `map_dbl(df_xyz, mean)` to an object in our global environment in the usual way (i.e., with the assignment arrow). This eliminates the need for creating a structure to hold our results ahead of time as we had to do with the for loop. It also eliminates the need to write code that explicitly updates the returned results structure at each iteration (i.e., `xyz_means[[i]]`) as we had to do with the for loop.\n\nHowever, one nice byproduct of creating the structure to hold our returned results ahead of time was that doing so made it obvious what form and type we expected our results to take. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Setting the type of the returned results structure I](compare_type1.png){width=6in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the `xyz_means` example above, it's obvious that we expected our returned results to be a vector of numbers because the structure we created to contain our results was a vector of type double.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Setting the type of the returned results structure II](compare_type2.png){width=6in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the `purrr::map` functions, which `map` function we choose will serve the same purpose. In the example above, we used `map_dbl()`, which implied that we expected our results to be a vector of type double. In fact, it not only implied that our results _should_ be a vector of type double, but it _guaranteed_ that our results _would_ be a vector of type double (or we would get an error). In this sense, the `map` functions are much safer to use than for loops -- we don't get unexpected results. \n\nAs a silly example, let's say that we want to extract the number of letters in each name contained in a vector of names. We'll start by creating a vector that contains three random names:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames <- c(\"Avril\", \"Joe\", \"Whitney\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let's create a structure to contain our results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_letters <- vector(\"double\", length(names)) # Expecting double\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code above (i.e., `vector(\"double\", length(names))`) implies that we expect our results to be type double, which make sense if we expect our results to be the number of letters in some names.\n\nFinally, let's write our for loop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor(i in seq_along(names)) {\n  n_letters[[i]] <- stringr::str_extract(names[[i]], \"\\\\w\") # Returns character\n}\n\nn_letters\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"A\" \"J\" \"W\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUh, oh! Those \"counts\" are letters! What happened? Well, apparently we thought that `stringr::str_extract(names[[i]], \"\\\\w\")` would return the count of letters in each name. In actuality, it returns the first letter in each name. \n\nAgain, this is a silly example. In this case, it's easy to see and fix our mistake. However, it could be very difficult to debug this problem if the code were buried in a long script or inside of other functions.\n\nNow, let's see what happens when we use `purrr`. We still start with the names:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames <- c(\"Avril\", \"Joe\", \"Whitney\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also still imply our expectations that the returned result should be a numeric vector. However, this time we do so by using the `map_dbl` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_letters <- map_dbl(\n  .x = names, \n  .f = stringr::str_extract, \"\\\\w{1}\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `map_dbl()`:\ni In index: 1.\nCaused by error:\n! Can't coerce from a string to a double.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, this time, we don't get an unexpected result. This time, we get an error. This may seem like a pain if you are newish to programming. But it's much better to get an error that you can go fix than an incorrect result that you are totally unaware of! \n\nWhile we are discussing return types, let's go ahead and introduce some of the other `map` functions. They are:\n\n* `map_dbl()`, which we've already seen. The `map_dbl()` function always returns a numeric vector or an error.\n\n* `map_int()`, which always returns an integer vector or an error.\n\n* `map_lgl()`, which always returns a logical vector or an error.\n\n* `map_chr()`, which always returns a character vector or an error.\n\n* `map_dfr()`, which always returns a data frame created by row-binding results or an error.\n\n* `map_dfc()`, which always returns a data frame created by column-binding results or an error.\n\n* `map()`, which is the most generic, and always returns a list (or an error). We've haven't discussed lists much in this book, but whenever something won't fit into any other kind of object, it will fit into a list.\n\n* `walk()`, which is the only `map` function without a `map` name. We will use `walk()` when we are more interested in the \"side-effects\" of the function passed to `.f` than its return value. What in the world does that mean? It means that the only thing `walk()` \"returns\" is exactly what was passed to its `.x` argument. No matter what you pass to the `.f` argument, the object passed to `.x` will be returned by `walk()` unmodified. Your next question might be, \"then what's the point? How could that ever be useful?\" Typically, `walk()` will only be useful to us for plotting (e.g., where you are interested in viewing the plots, but not saving them as an object) and/or data transfer (we will see an example of this below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Replacing the arguments in the for function with the object we pass to the .x argument of the map function](compare_object.png){width=6in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the object we pass to the `.x` function of the `map` function replaces the entire `i in seq_along(object)` pattern that is passed to the for loop. Again, if the object passed to the `.x` argument is a vector, then `map` will apply the function passed to the `.f` argument to each element of the vector. If the object passed to the `.x` argument is a data frame, then `map` will apply the function passed to the `.f` argument to each column of the data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Replacing the body of the for function with the function we pass to the .f argument of the map function](compare_function.png){width=6in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the function passed to the `.f` argument can replace the rest of the \"stuff\" going on in the for loop body. We can pass a single function (e.g., mean) to the `.f` argument as we did above. However, we can also pass anonymous functions to the `.f` argument. We pass anonymous functions to the `.f` function in basically the exact same way passed anonymous functions to the `.fns` argument of the `across()` function in the [chapter on column-wise operations](#column-wise-operations-in-dplyr). And, yes, we can also write our anonymous functions using purrr-style lambdas. In fact, the purrr-style lambda syntax is called the purrr-style lambda syntax because it was first created for the `purrr` package and later adopted by `dplyr::across()`. That name probably makes a lot more sense than it did a couple of chapters ago!\n\nThat pretty much covers the basics of using the `purrr::map` functions. If you've been reading this book in sequence, there won't really be any conceptually new material in this chapter. We're basically going to do the same things we've been doing for the last couple of chapters. We'll just be using a slightly different (and perhaps preferable) syntax. If you haven't been reading the book in sequence, you might want to read the chapters on [writing functions](#writing-functions), [column-wise operations](#column-wise-operations-in-dplyr), and [writing for loops](#writing-for-loops) to get the most of the examples below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Using purrr for data transfer\n\n### Example 1: Importing multiple sheets from an Excel workbook\n\nIn the [chapter on writing functions](#writing-functions) we used a for loop to help us import data from an Excel workbook that was stored across multiple sheets. We will once again go through this example using the `purrr` approach. \n\nThe simulated data contains some demographic information about three different cities: Houston, Atlanta, and Charlotte. In this scenario, we need to import each sheet, clean the data, and combine them into a single data frame in order to complete our analysis. First, we will load the `readxl` package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[You may click here to download this file to your computer.](https://github.com/brad-cannell/r4epi/blob/master/data/city_ses.xlsx)\n\nThen, we may import each sheet like this:\n\n<!-- No need to cache because eval=FALSE -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhouston <- read_excel(\n  \"city_ses.xlsx\",\n  sheet = \"Houston\"\n)\n\natlanta <- read_excel(\n  \"city_ses.xlsx\",\n  sheet = \"Atlanta\"\n)\n\ncharlotte <- read_excel(\n  \"city_ses.xlsx\",\n  sheet = \"Charlotte\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nðŸš©In the code chunks above, we have essentially the same code copied more than twice. That's a red flag that we should be thinking about removing unnecessary repetition from our code. So, our next step was to write a function to remove some of the unnecessary repetition:\n\n<!-- No need to cache because eval=FALSE -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimport_cities <- function(sheet) {\n  df <- read_excel(\n    \"city_ses.xlsx\",\n    sheet = sheet\n  )\n}\n\nhouston   <- import_cities(\"Houston\")\natlanta   <- import_cities(\"Atlanta\")\ncharlotte <- import_cities(\"Charlotte\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nðŸš©However, that approach still has some repetition. So, we next learned how to use a for loop as an alternative approach:\n\n<!-- No need to cache because eval=FALSE -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npath <- \"city_ses.xlsx\"\nsheets <- excel_sheets(path)\n\nfor(i in seq_along(sheets)) {\n  new_nm <- tolower(sheets[[i]])\n  assign(new_nm, read_excel(path, sheet = sheets[[i]]))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat works just fine! However, we could alternatively use `purrr::walk()` instead like this:\n\n<!-- No need to cache because eval=FALSE -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Save the file path to an object so we don't have to type it repeatedly \n# or hard-code it in.\npath <- \"city_ses.xlsx\"\n  \nwalk(\n  .x = excel_sheets(path),\n  .f = function(x) {\n    new_nm <- tolower(x)\n    assign(new_nm, read_excel(path, sheet = x), envir = .GlobalEnv)\n  }\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhouston\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\n  pid     age sex   ses_score\n  <chr> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>\n1 001      13 F            88\n2 003      13 F            78\n3 007      14 M            83\n4 014      12 F            76\n5 036      13 M            84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\natlanta\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\n  id      age gender ses_score\n  <chr> <dbl> <chr>      <dbl>\n1 002      14 M             64\n2 009      15 M             35\n3 012      13 F             70\n4 013      13 F             66\n5 022      12 F             59\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncharlotte\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\n  pid     age sex     ses\n  <chr> <dbl> <chr> <dbl>\n1 004      13 F        84\n2 011      14 M        66\n3 018      12 M        92\n4 023      12 M        89\n5 030      13 F        83\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nðŸ‘†**Here's what we did above:**\n\n* We used the `walk()` function from the `purrr` package to import every sheet from an Excel workbook.\n\n* First, we saved the path to the Excel workbook to a separate object. We didn't have to do this. However, doing so prevented us from having to type out the full file path repeatedly in the rest of our code. Additionally, if the file path ever changed, we would only have to update it in one place.\n\n* Second, we passed the return value of the `excel_sheets()` function, which is a character vector containing each sheet name, to the `.x` argument of the `walk()` function. We didn't have to do this. We could have typed each sheet name manually. However, there shouldn't be any accidental typos if we use the `excel_sheets()` function, and we don't have to make any changes to our code if more sheets are added to the Workbook in the future. \n\n* Third, we passed an anonymous function to the `walk()`'s `.f` argument. Inside the anonymous function, we assigned each data frame created by the `read_excel()` function to our global environment using the `assign()` function. Notice that because we are using the `assign()` _inside_ of another function, we have to explicitly tell the `assign()` function to assign the data frames being imported to the global environment using `envir = .GlobalEnv`. Without getting too technical, keep in mind that functions create their own little enclosed environments ([see a discussion here](#lexical-scoping-and-functions)), which makes the `envir = .GlobalEnv` part necessary.\n\nAdditionally, you may have some questions swirling around your head right now about the `walk()` function itself. In particular, you might be wondering why we used `walk()` instead of `map()` and why we didn't assign the return value of `walk()` to an object. We'll answer both questions next.\n\n### Why walk instead of map?\n\nThe short answer is that `map` functions return _one_ thing (i.e., a vector, list, or data frame). In this situation, we wanted to \"return\" _three_ things (i.e., the `houston` data frame, the `atlanta` data frame, and the `charlotte` data frame).\n\nTechnically, we could have used the `map()` function to return a list of data frames like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist_of_df <- map(\n  .x = excel_sheets(path),\n  .f = ~ read_excel(path, sheet = .x)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(list_of_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nList of 3\n $ : tibble [5 x 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n  ..$ pid      : chr [1:5] \"001\" \"003\" \"007\" \"014\" ...\n  ..$ age      : num [1:5] 13 13 14 12 13\n  ..$ sex      : chr [1:5] \"F\" \"F\" \"M\" \"F\" ...\n  ..$ ses_score: num [1:5] 88 78 83 76 84\n $ : tibble [5 x 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n  ..$ id       : chr [1:5] \"002\" \"009\" \"012\" \"013\" ...\n  ..$ age      : num [1:5] 14 15 13 13 12\n  ..$ gender   : chr [1:5] \"M\" \"M\" \"F\" \"F\" ...\n  ..$ ses_score: num [1:5] 64 35 70 66 59\n $ : tibble [5 x 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n  ..$ pid: chr [1:5] \"004\" \"011\" \"018\" \"023\" ...\n  ..$ age: num [1:5] 13 14 12 12 13\n  ..$ sex: chr [1:5] \"F\" \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n  ..$ ses: num [1:5] 84 66 92 89 83\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there, we could extract and modify each data frame from the list like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhouston <- list_of_df[[1]]\nhouston\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\n  pid     age sex   ses_score\n  <chr> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>\n1 001      13 F            88\n2 003      13 F            78\n3 007      14 M            83\n4 014      12 F            76\n5 036      13 M            84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\natlanta <- list_of_df[[2]]\natlanta\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\n  id      age gender ses_score\n  <chr> <dbl> <chr>      <dbl>\n1 002      14 M             64\n2 009      15 M             35\n3 012      13 F             70\n4 013      13 F             66\n5 022      12 F             59\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncharlotte <- list_of_df[[2]]\ncharlotte\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\n  id      age gender ses_score\n  <chr> <dbl> <chr>      <dbl>\n1 002      14 M             64\n2 009      15 M             35\n3 012      13 F             70\n4 013      13 F             66\n5 022      12 F             59\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, now we have a bunch of repetition again! Alternatively, we could have also used the `map_dfr()`, which always returns a data frame created by row-binding results or an error.

In this case, that would just be the sheet names:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreturned_by_walk <- walk(\n  .x = excel_sheets(path),\n  .f = function(x) {\n    new_nm <- tolower(x)\n    assign(new_nm, read_excel(path, sheet = x), envir = .GlobalEnv)\n  }\n)\n\nreturned_by_walk\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Houston\"   \"Atlanta\"   \"Charlotte\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't be confused, the data frames are still being imported and assigned to the global environment via the anonymous function we passed to `.f` above.

So, we ignored the unnecessary repetition in the code above. But, for all the reasons we've been discussing, we should strive to write more robust code. Imagine, for example, that you were adding missing data to hundreds or thousands of rows as part of a simulation study. Using the method above would become problematic pretty quickly.\n\nIn this case, it might be useful to start our solution with writing a function ([click here to review function writing](#writing-functions)). Let's name our function `add_na_at()` because it helps us add an `NA` value to a vector at a position of our choosing. Logically, then, it follows that we will need to be able to pass our function a _vector_ that we want to add the `NA` value to, and a _position_ to add the `NA` value at. So, our first attempt might look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_na_at <- function(vect, pos) {\n  vect[[pos]] <- NA\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's test it out:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_na_at(df_xyz$x, 2) %>% print()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs a single `NA` the result we wanted? Nope! If this result is surprising to you, please review the [section of the writing functions chapter on return values](#the-values-your-functions-return). Briefly, the last line of our function body is the single value `df_xyz$x[[2]]`, which was set to be equal to `NA`. But, we don't want our function to return just one position of the vector -- we want it to return the entire vector. So, let's reference the entire vector on the last line of the function body:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_na_at <- function(vect, pos) {\n  vect[[pos]] <- NA\n  vect\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_na_at(df_xyz$x, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] -0.56047565          NA  1.55870831  0.07050839  0.12928774  1.71506499\n [7]  0.46091621 -1.26506123 -0.68685285 -0.44566197\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's better!

A case could be made that this code is easier to quickly glance at and understand, but it isn't much less repetitive. That's where `purrr` comes in. Let's try using `purrr` to come up with a better solution now. \n\nThe first question we might ask ourselves is, \"which `map` function should we choose?\" Well, we know we want our end result to be a data frame, so it makes sense for us to choose either `map_dfr` or `map_dfc`. However, it might be useful to start with the plain `map()` function that returns a list as we begin to experiment with solving a problem using `purrr`. This is because R can put almost anything into a list, and therefore, we will almost always get _something_ returned to us (as opposed to an error) by `map()`. Further, the thing returned to us typically can provide us with some insight into what's going on inside `.f`. \n\nNext, we know that we want to iterate over every column of the `df_xyz` data frame. So, we can pass it to the `.x` argument.\n\nWe also know that we want each column to get passed to the `vect` argument of `add_na_at()` iteratively. So, we want to pass `add_na_at` (without parentheses) to the `.f` argument.\n\nFinally, we can't supply `add_na_at()` with just one argument -- the vector -- can we? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_na_at(df_xyz$x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in vect[[pos]] <- NA: missing subscript\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo way! We have to give it position as well. Do you remember which argument allows us to pass any additional arguments to the function we passed to the `.f` argument?\n\nThe `...` argument is where we pass any additional arguments to the function we passed to the `.f` argument. But remember, we don't actually type out `... =`. We simply type additional arguments, separated by commas, after the function name supplied to `.f`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap(\n  .x = df_xyz,\n  .f = add_na_at, 2\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$x\n [1] -0.56047565          NA  1.55870831  0.07050839  0.12928774  1.71506499\n [7]  0.46091621 -1.26506123 -0.68685285 -0.44566197\n\n$y\n [1]  1.2240818         NA  0.4007715         NA -0.5558411  1.7869131\n [7]  0.4978505 -1.9666172  0.7013559 -0.4727914\n\n$z\n [1] -1.0678237         NA -1.0260044 -0.7288912 -0.6250393         NA\n [7]  0.8377870  0.1533731 -1.1381369  1.2538149\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr alternatively, we can use the purrr-style lambda to pass our function to `.f`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap(\n  .x = df_xyz,\n  .f = ~ add_na_at(.x, 2)\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$x\n [1] -0.56047565          NA  1.55870831  0.07050839  0.12928774  1.71506499\n [7]  0.46091621 -1.26506123 -0.68685285 -0.44566197\n\n$y\n [1]  1.2240818         NA  0.4007715         NA -0.5558411  1.7869131\n [7]  0.4978505 -1.9666172  0.7013559 -0.4727914\n\n$z\n [1] -1.0678237         NA -1.0260044 -0.7288912 -0.6250393         NA\n [7]  0.8377870  0.1533731 -1.1381369  1.2538149\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we have to use the special `.x` symbol inside the function call where we would normally want to type the name of the column we want the function to operate on. We saw something similar before in the [chapter on column-wise operations](#column-wise-operations-in-dplyr). \n\nNow, let's discuss the result we are getting. The result you see above is a list, which is what `map()` will always return to us. Specifically, this is a list with three elements -- `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each element of the list is a vector of numbers. Does this feel familiar? Does it seem sort of similar to a data frame? If so, good intuition! In R, a data frame _is_ a list. It's simply a special case of a list. It's a special case because all vectors in the data frame must have the length, and because R knows to print each vector to the screen as a column. In fact, we can easily convert the list above to a data frame by passing it to the `as.data.frame()` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap(\n  .x = df_xyz,\n  .f = ~ add_na_at(.x, 2)\n) %>% \n  as.data.frame()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             x          y          z\n1  -0.56047565  1.2240818 -1.0678237\n2           NA         NA         NA\n3   1.55870831  0.4007715 -1.0260044\n4   0.07050839         NA -0.7288912\n5   0.12928774 -0.5558411 -0.6250393\n6   1.71506499  1.7869131         NA\n7   0.46091621  0.4978505  0.8377870\n8  -1.26506123 -1.9666172  0.1533731\n9  -0.68685285  0.7013559 -1.1381369\n10 -0.44566197 -0.4727914  1.2538149\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could just use `map_dfc` as a shortcut instead:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfc(\n  .x = df_xyz,\n  .f = ~ add_na_at(.x, 2)\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n         x      y      z\n     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 -0.560   1.22  -1.07 \n 2 NA      NA     NA    \n 3  1.56    0.401 -1.03 \n 4  0.0705 NA     -0.729\n 5  0.129  -0.556 -0.625\n 6  1.72    1.79  NA    \n 7  0.461   0.498  0.838\n 8 -1.27   -1.97   0.153\n 9 -0.687   0.701 -1.14 \n10 -0.446  -0.473  1.25 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy `map_dfc` instead of `map_dfr`? Because we want to combine `x`, `y`, and `z` together as _columns_, not as rows.\n\nOk, so we almost have the solution we want. There's just one problem. In the code above, the `NA` is always being put into the second position because we have `2` hard-coded into `add_na_at(.x, 2)`. We need a way to iterate over our columns _and_ a set of numbers _simultaneously_ in order to get the final result we want. Fortunately, that's exactly what the `map2` variants (i.e., `map2_dbl()`, `map2_int()`, `map2_lgl()`, etc.) of each of the `map` functions allows us to do.\n\nInstead of supplying map a single object to iterate over (i.e., `.x`) we can supply it with _two_ objects to iterate over (i.e., `.x` and `.y`):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap2_dfc(\n  .x = df_xyz,\n  .y = c(2, 4, 6),\n  .f = ~ add_na_at(.x, .y)\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n         x      y      z\n     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 -0.560   1.22  -1.07 \n 2 NA       0.360 -0.218\n 3  1.56    0.401 -1.03 \n 4  0.0705 NA     -0.729\n 5  0.129  -0.556 -0.625\n 6  1.72    1.79  NA    \n 7  0.461   0.498  0.838\n 8 -1.27   -1.97   0.153\n 9 -0.687   0.701 -1.14 \n10 -0.446  -0.473  1.25 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes take a second to wrap your mind around.

Then, the `.x` and `.y` were replaced with `df_xyz$x` and `2` respectively in the function we passed to `.f`. The result of that iteration was a vector of numbers that was identical to `df_xyz$x` except that its second element was an `NA`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Illustrating how map iterates over two objects simultaneously - II](iteration_1_2.png){width=6in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second iteration, `.x` took on the value of the second column in the `df_xyz` data frame (i.e., `y`) and `.y` took on the value of the second element in the numeric vector that we passed to the `.y` argument (i.e., `4`). Then, the `.x` and `.y` were replaced with `df_xyz$y` and `4` respectively in the function we passed to `.f`.

The result of that iteration was a vector of numbers that was identical to `df_xyz$z` except that its sixth element was an `NA`.\n\nFinally, `map2_dfc()` passed all of these vectors to `bind_cols()` (invisibly to us) and returned them as a data frame.\n\nThe code above gives us our entire solution. But, if we really were using this code in a simulation with hundreds or thousands of columns, we probably wouldn't want to manually supply a vector of column positions to the `.y` argument. Instead, we could use the `sample()` function to supply random column positions to the `.y` argument like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(8142020)\n\nmap2_dfc(\n  .x = df_xyz,\n  .y = sample(1:10, 3, TRUE),\n  .f = ~ add_na_at(.x, .y)\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n         x      y      z\n     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 -0.560  NA     -1.07 \n 2 NA       0.360 -0.218\n 3  1.56    0.401 -1.03 \n 4  0.0705 NA     -0.729\n 5  0.129  -0.556 -0.625\n 6  1.72    1.79  NA    \n 7  0.461   0.498  0.838\n 8 -1.27   -1.97  NA    \n 9 NA       0.701 -1.14 \n10 -0.446  -0.473  1.25 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty nice, right?\n\nBefore moving on, note that we did not have to create the `add_na_at()` function ahead of time the way we did.

In that scenario, we wanted to see if first name, last name, and street name matched at each ID between our data frames. More specifically, we wanted to combine the two data frames into a single data frame and create three new dummy variables that indicated whether first name, last name, and address matched respectively. \n\nHere are the data frames we simulated and combined:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npeople_1 <- tribble(\n  ~id_1, ~name_first_1, ~name_last_1, ~street_1,\n  1,     \"Easton\",      NA,           \"Alameda\",\n  2,     \"Elias\",       \"Salazar\",    \"Crissy Field\",\n  3,     \"Colton\",      \"Fox\",        \"San Bruno\",\n  4,     \"Cameron\",     \"Warren\",     \"Nottingham\",\n  5,     \"Carson\",      \"Mills\",      \"Jersey\",\n  6,     \"Addison\",     \"Meyer\",      \"Tingley\",\n  7,     \"Aubrey\",      \"Rice\",       \"Buena Vista\",\n  8,     \"Ellie\",       \"Schmidt\",    \"Division\",\n  9,     \"Robert\",      \"Garza\",      \"Red Rock\",\n  10,    \"Stella\",      \"Daniels\",    \"Holland\"\n)\n\npeople_2 <- tribble(\n  ~id_2, ~name_first_2, ~name_last_2, ~street_2,\n  1,     \"Easton\",      \"Stone\",      \"Alameda\",\n  2,     \"Elas\",        \"Salazar\",    \"Field\",\n  3,     NA,            \"Fox\",        NA,\n  4,     \"Cameron\",     \"Waren\",      \"Notingham\",\n  5,     \"Carsen\",      \"Mills\",      \"Jersey\",\n  6,     \"Adison\",      NA,           NA,\n  7,     \"Aubrey\",      \"Rice\",       \"Buena Vista\",\n  8,     NA,            \"Schmidt\",    \"Division\",\n  9,     \"Bob\",         \"Garza\",      \"Red Rock\",\n  10,    \"Stella\",      NA,           \"Holland\"\n)\n\npeople <- people_1 %>% \n  bind_cols(people_2) %>% \n  print()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 8\n    id_1 name_first_1 name_last_1 street_1      id_2 name_first_2 name_last_2\n   <dbl> <chr>        <chr>       <chr>        <dbl> <chr>        <chr>      \n 1     1 Easton       <NA>        Alameda          1 Easton       Stone      \n 2     2 Elias        Salazar     Crissy Field     2 Elas         Salazar    \n 3     3 Colton       Fox         San Bruno        3 <NA>         Fox        \n 4     4 Cameron      Warren      Nottingham       4 Cameron      Waren      \n 5     5 Carson       Mills       Jersey           5 Carsen       Mills      \n 6     6 Addison      Meyer       Tingley          6 Adison       <NA>       \n 7     7 Aubrey       Rice        Buena Vista      7 Aubrey       Rice       \n 8     8 Ellie        Schmidt     Division         8 <NA>         Schmidt    \n 9     9 Robert       Garza       Red Rock         9 Bob          Garza      \n10    10 Stella       Daniels     Holland         10 Stella       <NA>       \n# i 1 more variable: street_2 <chr>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the function we wrote to help us create the dummy variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nis_match <- function(value_1, value_2) {\n  result <- value_1 == value_2\n  result <- if_else(is.na(result), FALSE, result)\n  result\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is how we applied the function we wrote to get our results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npeople %>% \n  mutate(\n    name_first_match = is_match(name_first_1, name_first_2),\n    name_last_match  = is_match(name_last_1, name_last_2),\n    street_match     = is_match(street_1, street_2)\n  ) %>% \n  # Order like columns next to each other for easier comparison\n  select(id_1, starts_with(\"name_f\"), starts_with(\"name_l\"), starts_with(\"s\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 10\n    id_1 name_first_1 name_first_2 name_first_match name_last_1 name_last_2\n   <dbl> <chr>        <chr>        <lgl>            <chr>       <chr>      \n 1     1 Easton       Easton       TRUE             <NA>        Stone      \n 2     2 Elias        Elas         FALSE            Salazar     Salazar    \n 3     3 Colton       <NA>         FALSE            Fox         Fox        \n 4     4 Cameron      Cameron      TRUE             Warren      Waren      \n 5     5 Carson       Carsen       FALSE            Mills       Mills      \n 6     6 Addison      Adison       FALSE            Meyer       <NA>       \n 7     7 Aubrey       Aubrey       TRUE             Rice        Rice       \n 8     8 Ellie        <NA>         FALSE            Schmidt     Schmidt    \n 9     9 Robert       Bob          FALSE            Garza       Garza      \n10    10 Stella       Stella       TRUE             Daniels     <NA>       \n# i 4 more variables: name_last_match <lgl>, street_1 <chr>, street_2 <chr>,\n#   street_match <lgl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nðŸš©However, in the code chunk above, we still have essentially the same code copied more than twice. That's a red flag that we should be thinking about removing unnecessary repetition from our code. Because we are using dplyr, and all of our data resides inside of a single data frame, your first instinct might be to use `across()` inside of `mutate()` to perform column-wise operations. Unfortunately, that method won't work in this scenario. \n\nThe `across()` function will apply the function we pass to the `.fns` argument to each column passed to the `.cols` argument, one at a time. But, we need to pass two columns at a time to the `is_match()` function. For example, `name_first_1` _and_ `name_first_2`. That makes this task a little trickier than most. But, here's how we accomplished it using a for loop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncols <- c(\"name_first\", \"name_last\", \"street\")\n\nfor(i in seq_along(cols)) {\n  col_1   <- paste0(cols[[i]], \"_1\")\n  col_2   <- paste0(cols[[i]], \"_2\")\n  new_col <- paste0(cols[[i]], \"_match\")\n  people[[new_col]] <- is_match(people[[col_1]], people[[col_2]])\n}\n\npeople %>% \n  select(id_1, starts_with(\"name_f\"), starts_with(\"name_l\"), starts_with(\"s\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 10\n    id_1 name_first_1 name_first_2 name_first_match name_last_1 name_last_2\n   <dbl> <chr>        <chr>        <lgl>            <chr>       <chr>      \n 1     1 Easton       Easton       TRUE             <NA>        Stone      \n 2     2 Elias        Elas         FALSE            Salazar     Salazar    \n 3     3 Colton       <NA>         FALSE            Fox         Fox        \n 4     4 Cameron      Cameron      TRUE             Warren      Waren      \n 5     5 Carson       Carsen       FALSE            Mills       Mills      \n 6     6 Addison      Adison       FALSE            Meyer       <NA>       \n 7     7 Aubrey       Aubrey       TRUE             Rice        Rice       \n 8     8 Ellie        <NA>         FALSE            Schmidt     Schmidt    \n 9     9 Robert       Bob          FALSE            Garza       Garza      \n10    10 Stella       Stella       TRUE             Daniels     <NA>       \n# i 4 more variables: name_last_match <lgl>, street_1 <chr>, street_2 <chr>,\n#   street_match <lgl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's go over one way to get the same result using `purrr`.

However, this code still has some advantages. We only typed \"name_first\", \"name_last\", and \"street\" once at the beginning of the code chunk. Therefore, we didn't have to worry about forgetting to change a column name after copying and pasting code. Additionally, if we later decide that we also want to compare other columns (e.g., middle name, birth date, city, state, zip code), we only have to update the code in one place -- where we create the `cols` vector. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Using purrr for analysis\n\nLet's return to the examples from the [column-wise operations chapter](#across-with-summarise) and the [chapter on writing for loops](#using-for-loops-for-analysis) for our discussion of using the `purrr` package to remove unnecessary repetition from our analyses.

That's a red flag that we should be thinking about removing unnecessary repetition. We've already seen how to accomplish this goal using the `across()` function. Now, let's learn how to accomplish this goal using the `purrr` package. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfr(\n  .x = quos(age, ht_in, wt_lbs, bmi),\n  .f = continuous_stats\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 x 5\n  n_miss  mean median   min   max\n   <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1      1  26.9   26    22    48  \n2      3  66.0   66    58    76  \n3      2 148.   142.   60   297  \n4      4  23.6   22.9  10.6  45.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nðŸ‘†**Here's what we did above:**\n\n* We used the `map_dfr()` function from the `purrr` package to iteratively pass the columns `age`, `ht_in`, `wt_lbs`, and `bmi` to our `continuous_stats` function _and_ row-bind the results into a single results data frame. \n\n* We haven't seen the `quos()` function before. It's another one of those tidy evaluation functions. You can type `?rlang::quos` in your console to read more about it. When we can wrap a single column name with the `quo()` function, or a list of column names with the `quos()` function, we are telling R to look for them in the data frame being passed to a `dplyr` verb rather than looking for them as objects in the global environment. \n\nAt this point, you may be wondering which row in the results data frame above corresponds to which variable? Great question! When we were using `continuous_stats()` to analyze one variable at a time, it didn't really matter that the variable name wasn't part of the output. However, now that we are apply `continuous_stats()` to multiple columns, it would really be nice to have the column name in the results. Luckily, we can easily make that happen with one small tweak to our `continuous_stats()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncontinuous_stats <- function(var) {\n  study %>% \n    summarise(\n      variable = quo_name(var), # Add variable name to the output\n      n_miss   = sum(is.na({{ var }})),\n      mean     = mean({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n      median   = median({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n      min      = min({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n      max      = max({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nðŸ‘†**Here's what we did above:**\n\n* We used the `quo_name()` function to grab the name of the column being passed to the `summarise()` function and turn it into a character string. Then, we assigned that character string to column in the results data frame called `variable`. So, when the `age` column is passed to `summarise()` inside of the function body, `quo_name(var)` returns the value `\"age\"` and then that value is assigned to the `variable` column in the expression `variable = quo_name(var)`.\n\nLet's try out our new and improved `continuous_stats()` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfr(\n  .x = quos(age, ht_in, wt_lbs, bmi),\n  .f = continuous_stats\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 x 6\n  variable n_miss  mean median   min   max\n  <chr>     <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 age           1  26.9   26    22    48  \n2 ht_in         3  66.0   66    58    76  \n3 wt_lbs        2 148.   142.   60   297  \n4 bmi           4  23.6   22.9  10.6  45.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat works great, but we'd probably like to be able to use `continuous_stats()` with other data frames too. Currently, we can't do that because we have the `study` data frame hard-coded into our function. Luckily, we've already seen how to replace a hard-coded data frame by adding a `data` argument to our function like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncontinuous_stats <- function(data, var) {\n  data %>%  # Don't forget to replace \"study\" with \"data\" here too!\n    summarise(\n      variable = quo_name(var),\n      n_miss   = sum(is.na({{ var}} )),\n      mean     = mean({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n      median   = median({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n      min      = min({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n      max      = max({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, we can analyze all the continuous variables in the `study` data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfr(\n  .x = quos(age, ht_in, wt_lbs, bmi),\n  .f = continuous_stats, data = study\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 x 6\n  variable n_miss  mean median   min   max\n  <chr>     <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 age           1  26.9   26    22    48  \n2 ht_in         3  66.0   66    58    76  \n3 wt_lbs        2 148.   142.   60   297  \n4 bmi           4  23.6   22.9  10.6  45.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd all the continuous variables in the `df_xyz` data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfr(\n  .x = quos(x, y, z),\n  .f = continuous_stats, data = df_xyz\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 x 6\n  variable n_miss   mean  median   min   max\n  <chr>     <int>  <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 x             1  0.108  0.0705 -1.27  1.72\n2 y             1  0.220  0.401  -1.97  1.79\n3 z             1 -0.284 -0.625  -1.14  1.25\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Example 2: Categorical statistics\n\nFor our second example of using the `purrr` package for analysis, we'll once again write some code to iteratively analyze all the categorical variables in our `study` data frame. In the last chapter, we learned how to use a for loop to do this analysis. As a refresher, here is the final solution we arrived at:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Structure 1. An object to contain the results.\n  # Create the data frame structure that will contain our results\ncat_table <- tibble(\n  variable = vector(\"character\"), \n  category = vector(\"character\"), \n  n        = vector(\"numeric\")\n) \n\n# Structure 2. The actual for loop.\n  # For each column, get the column name, category names, and count.\n  # Then, add them to the bottom of the results data frame we created above.\nfor(i in c(\"age_group\", \"gender\", \"bmi_3cat\")) {\n  cat_stats <- study %>% \n    count(.data[[i]]) %>% # Use .data to refer to the current data frame.\n    mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% # Use . to refer to the current data frame.\n    rename(category = 1)\n  \n  # Here is where we update cat_table with the results for each column\n  cat_table <- bind_rows(cat_table, cat_stats)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat_table\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n   variable  category            n\n   <chr>     <chr>           <dbl>\n 1 age_group Younger than 30    56\n 2 age_group 30 and Older       11\n 3 age_group <NA>                1\n 4 gender    Female             43\n 5 gender    Male               24\n 6 gender    <NA>                1\n 7 bmi_3cat  Normal             43\n 8 bmi_3cat  Overweight         16\n 9 bmi_3cat  Obese               5\n10 bmi_3cat  <NA>                4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use `purrr` instead, we can pretty much copy and paste the code from the for loop body above as an anonymous function to the `.f` argument to `map_dfr()` like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfr(\n  .x = c(\"age_group\", \"gender\", \"bmi_3cat\"),\n  .f = function(x) {\n    study %>% \n      count(.data[[x]]) %>% \n      mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% \n      rename(category = 1) %>% \n      select(variable, category, n)\n  }\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n   variable  category            n\n   <chr>     <fct>           <int>\n 1 age_group Younger than 30    56\n 2 age_group 30 and Older       11\n 3 age_group <NA>                1\n 4 gender    Female             43\n 5 gender    Male               24\n 6 gender    <NA>                1\n 7 bmi_3cat  Normal             43\n 8 bmi_3cat  Overweight         16\n 9 bmi_3cat  Obese               5\n10 bmi_3cat  <NA>                4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the code that is _doing the analysis_ is exactly the same in our for loop solution and our `purrr` solution. However, in this case, the `purrr` solution requires a lot less code _around_ the analysis code. And, for some, the `purrr` code is easier to read. \n\nIf we didn't want to type our column names in quotes, we could use tidy evaluation again. All we have to do is pass the column names to the `quos()` function in the `.x` argument and change the `.data[[x]]` being passed to the `count()` function to `{{ x }}` like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfr(\n  .x = quos(age_group, gender, bmi_3cat), # Change c() to quos()\n  .f = function(x) {\n    study %>% \n      count({{ x }}) %>% # Change .data[[x]] to {{ x }}\n      mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% \n      rename(category = 1) %>% \n      select(variable, category, n)\n  }\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n   variable  category            n\n   <chr>     <fct>           <int>\n 1 age_group Younger than 30    56\n 2 age_group 30 and Older       11\n 3 age_group <NA>                1\n 4 gender    Female             43\n 5 gender    Male               24\n 6 gender    <NA>                1\n 7 bmi_3cat  Normal             43\n 8 bmi_3cat  Overweight         16\n 9 bmi_3cat  Obese               5\n10 bmi_3cat  <NA>                4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd as before, we'd probably like to be able to use this code with other data frames too. So, we will once again replace a hard-coded data frame by adding a `data` argument to our function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfr(\n  .x = quos(age_group, gender, bmi_3cat),\n  .f = function(x, data = study) {\n    data %>% # Don't forget to replace \"study\" with \"data\" here too!\n      count({{ x }}) %>% \n      mutate(variable = names(.)[1]) %>% \n      rename(category = 1) %>% \n      select(variable, category, n)\n  }\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 3\n   variable  category            n\n   <chr>     <fct>           <int>\n 1 age_group Younger than 30    56\n 2 age_group 30 and Older       11\n 3 age_group <NA>                1\n 4 gender    Female             43\n 5 gender    Male               24\n 6 gender    <NA>                1\n 7 bmi_3cat  Normal             43\n 8 bmi_3cat  Overweight         16\n 9 bmi_3cat  Obese               5\n10 bmi_3cat  <NA>                4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that concludes the chapter! You might feel a little bit like your head is swimming at this point. It was a lot to take in! As was stated at the end of the for loop chapter, it is not recommended to memorize everything we covered in this chapter. Instead, we recommend that you read it until you sort of get the general idea of the `purrr` package and when it might be useful. Then, refer back to this chapter, or other online references that discuss the `purrr` package (there are many good ones out there), if you find yourself in a situation where you believe that the `purrr` package might be the right tool to help you complete a given programming task.  \n\nIf you feel as though you want to take a deeper dive into the `purrr` package right away, then we suggest checking out the [iteration chapter of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#for-loops-vs.functionals). For an even deeper dive, the [functionals chapter of Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html) is recommended.\n\nThis concludes the repeated operations part of the book. If you aren't feeling totally comfortable with the material we covered in this part of the book right now, that's ok. You're not expected to yet. It takes _time_ and _practice_ for most people to be able to wrap their head around repeated operations. You are on track at this point as long as you understand why unnecessary repetition in your code is generally something you want to avoid. Then, slowly start using any of the methods _you feel most comfortable with_ to remove the unnecessary repetition from your code. Start by doing so in very simple cases and gradually work your way up to more complicated cases. With some practice, you may eventually think this stuff is even fun!\n\n\n",
