He has particular expertise in time series modeling, mixed effects modeling, econometric methods, and power analysis. As part of his work involving community trials, he has been the statistician on the long term follow-up study of a school based cluster randomized trial in low-income communities with a focus on explaining the etiology of risky alcohol, drug, and sexual behaviors. Additionally, he was the statistician for a longitudinal study examining the etiology of alcohol use among racially diverse and economically disadvantaged urban youth, and co-investigator for a NIAAA- and NIDA-funded trial to prevent alcohol use and alcohol-related problems among youth living in high-risk, low-income communities within the Cherokee Nation. Prevention work at the community level led him to an interest in the impact of state and federal socioeconomic policies on health outcomes. He is a Co-Investigator of a 50-state, 30-year study of effects of state-level economic and education policies on a diverse set of public health outcomes, explicitly examining differential effects across disadvantaged subgroups of the population.\n\nHis current research interests center around the application of quasi-experimental design and econometric methods to the evaluation of the health effects of state and federal policy.\n\n**Contact**    \nConnect with Dr. Livingston and follow his work.   \n<a href=\"https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=melvin-livingston-8970\" target=\"_blank\">`<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" style=\"height:2em;width:2em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:#003087;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M352 256c0 22.2-1.2 43.6-3.3 64H163.3c-2.2-20.4-3.3-41.8-3.3-64s1.2-43.6 3.3-64H348.7c2.2 20.4 3.3 41.8 3.3 64zm28.8-64H503.9c5.3 20.5 8.1 41.9 8.1 64s-2.8 43.5-8.1 64H380.8c2.1-20.6 3.2-42 3.2-64s-1.1-43.4-3.2-64zm112.6-32H376.7c-10-63.9-29.8-117.4-55.3-151.6c78.3 20.7 142 77.5 171.9 151.6zm-149.1 0H167.7c6.1-36.4 15.5-68.6 27-94.7c10.5-23.6 22.2-40.7 33.5-51.5C239.4 3.2 248.7 0 256 0s16.6 3.2 27.8 13.8c11.3 10.8 23 27.9 33.5 51.5c11.6 26 20.9 58.2 27 94.7zm-209 0H18.6C48.6 85.9 112.2 29.1 190.6 8.4C165.1 42.6 145.3 96.1 135.3 160zM8.1 192H131.2c-2.1 20.6-3.2 42-3.2 64s1.1 43.4 3.2 64H8.1C2.8 299.5 0 278.1 0 256s2.8-43.5 8.1-64zM194.7 446.6c-11.6-26-20.9-58.2-27-94.6H344.3c-6.1 36.4-15.5 68.6-27 94.6c-10.5 23.6-22.2 40.7-33.5 51.5C272.6 508.8 263.3 512 256 512s-16.6-3.2-27.8-13.8c-11.3-10.8-23-27.9-33.5-51.5zM135.3 352c10 63.9 29.8 117.4 55.3 151.6C112.2 482.9 48.6 426.1 18.6 352H135.3zm358.1 0c-30 74.1-93.6 130.9-171.9 151.6c25.5-34.2 45.2-87.7 55.3-151.6H493.4z\"/></svg>`{=html}</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MD3_Phd\" target=\"_blank\">`<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 448 512\" style=\"height:2em;width:1.75em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:#198CD8;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M64 32C28.7 32 0 60.7 0 96V416c0 35.3 28.7 64 64 64H384c35.3 0 64-28.7 64-64V96c0-35.3-28.7-64-64-64H64zM351.3 199.3v0c0 86.7-66 186.6-186.6 186.6c-37.2 0-71.7-10.8-100.7-29.4c5.3 .6 10.4 .8 15.8 .8c30.7 0 58.9-10.4 81.4-28c-28.8-.6-53-19.5-61.3-45.5c10.1 1.5 19.2 1.5 29.6-1.2c-30-6.1-52.5-32.5-52.5-64.4v-.8c8.7 4.9 18.9 7.9 29.6 8.3c-9-6-16.4-14.1-21.5-23.6s-7.8-20.2-7.7-31c0-12.2 3.2-23.4 8.9-33.1c32.3 39.8 80.8 65.8 135.2 68.6c-9.3-44.5 24-80.6 64-80.6c18.9 0 35.9 7.9 47.9 20.7c14.8-2.8 29-8.3 41.6-15.8c-4.9 15.2-15.2 28-28.8 36.1c13.2-1.4 26-5.1 37.8-10.2c-8.9 13.1-20.1 24.7-32.9 34c.2 2.8 .2 5.7 .2 8.5z\"/></svg>`{=html}</a>",
