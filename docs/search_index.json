This is true for novice R users and experienced R veterans alike. Getting useful answers to programming questions can be really complicated under the best conditions (i.e., where someone with experience can physically sit down next to you interactively work through your code with you). In reality, getting answers to our coding questions is often further complicated by the fact that we don’t have access to an experienced R programmer who can sit down next to us and help us debug our code. Therefore, this chapter will provide us with some guidance for seeking R programming help remotely. I’m not going to lie, this will likely be a frustrating process at times, but we will get through it! An example Because we like to start with the end in mind, click here for an example of a real post that we created on Stack Overflow. We will refer back to this post below. 6.1 When should we seek help? Imagine yourself sitting in front of your computer on a Wednesday afternoon. You are working on a project that requires the analysis of some data. You know that you need to clean up your data a little bit before you can do your analysis. For example, maybe you need to drop all the rows from your data that have a missing value for a set of variables. Before you drop them, you want to take a look at which rows meet this criterion and what information would potentially be lost by dropping them. In other words, you just want to view the rows of your data that have a missing value for any variable. Sounds simple enough! However, you start typing out the code to make this happen and that’s when you start to run into problems. At this point, the problem you encounter will typically come in one of a few different flavors. As you sit down to write the code, you realize that you don’t really even know where to start. You happily start typing out the code that you believe should work, but when you run the code you get an error message. You happily start typing out the code that you believe should work, but when you run the code you don’t get the result you were expecting. You happily start typing out the code that you believe should work and it does! However, you notice that your solution seems clunky, inefficient, or otherwise less than ideal. In any of these cases, you will need to figure out what your next step will be. We believe that there is typically a lot of value in starting out by attempting to solve the problem on your own without directly asking others for help. Doing so will often lead you to a deeper understanding of the solution than you would obtain by simply being given the answer. Further, finding the solution on your own helps you develop problem-solving skills that will be useful for the next coding problem you encounter – even if the details of that problem are completely different than the details of your current problem. Having said that, finding a solution on your own does not mean attempting to do so in a vacuum without the use of any resources (e.g., textbooks, existing code, or the internet). By all means, use available resources (we suggest some good ones below)! On the other hand, we – the authors – have found ourselves stubbornly hacking away on our own solution to a coding problem long after doing so ceased being productive on many occasions. We don’t recommend doing this either. We hope that the guidance in this chapter will provide you with some tools for effectively and efficiently seeking help from the broader R programming community once you’ve made a sincere effort to solve the problem on your own. But, how long should you attempt to solve the problem on your own before reaching out for help? As far as we know, there are no hard-and-fast rules about how long you should wait before seeking help with coding problems from others. In reality, the ideal amount of time to wait is probably dependent on a host of factors including the nature of the problem, your level of experience, project deadlines, all of your little personal idiosyncrasies, and a whole host of other factors. Therefore, the best guidance we can provide is pretty vague. In general, it isn’t ideal to reach out to the R programming community for help as soon as you encounter a problem, nor is it typically ideal to spend many hours attempting to solve a coding problem that could be solved in few minutes if you were to post a well-written question on Stack Overflow or the RStudio Community (more on these below). 6.2 Where should we seek help? Where should you turn once you’ve determined that it is time to seek help for your coding problem? We suggest that you simply start with Google. Very often, a quick Google search will give you the results you need to help you solve your problem. However, Google search results won’t always have the answer you are looking for. If you’ve done a Google search and you still can’t figure out how to solve your coding problem, we recommend posting a question on one of the following two websites: Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/). This is a great website where programmers who use many different languages help each other solve programming problems. This website is free, but you will need to create an account. RStudio Community (https://community.rstudio.com/). Another great discussion-board-type website from the people who created a lot of the software we will use in this book. This website is also free, but also requires you to create an account. 6.3 How should we seek help? At this point, you’ve run into a problem, you’ve spent a little time trying to work out a solution in your head, you’ve searched Google for a solution to the problem, and you’ve still come up short. So, you decide to ask the R programming community for some help using Stack Overflow. But, how do you do that? 🗒Side Note: We’ve decided to show you haw to create a post on Stack Overflow in this section, but the process for creating a post in the RStudio Community is very similar. Further, an RStudio Community tutorial is available here: https://community.rstudio.com/t/example-question-answer-topic-thread/70762. 6.3.1 Creating a post on Stack Overflow The first thing you need to do is navigate to the Stack Overflow website. The homepage will look something like the screenshot below. Next, you will click the blue “Ask Question” button. Doing so will take you to a screen like the following. As you can see, you need to give your post a title, you need to post the actual question in the body section of the form, and then you can (and should) tag your post. “A tag is simply a word or a phrase that describes the topic of the question.”1 When you have completed the form, you simply click the blue “Review your question” button towards the bottom-left corner of the screen. 6.3.1.1 Inserting R code To insert R code into your post (i.e., in the body), you will need to create code blocks. Then, you will type your R code inside of the code blocks. You can create code blocks using back-ticks ( ` ). The back-tick key is the upper-left key of most keyboards – right below the escape key. On our keyboard, the back-tick and the tilde ( ~ ) share the same button. We will learn more about code blocks in the chapter on using R markdown. For now, let’s just take a look at an example of creating a code block in the screenshot below. This screenshot comes from the example Stack Overflow post introduced at the beginning of the chapter. As you can see, we placed three back-ticks on their own line before our R code and three back-ticks on their own line after our R code. Alternatively, we could have used our mouse to highlight our R code and then clicked the code format button, which is highlighted in the screenshot above and looks like an empty pair of curly braces ( {} ). 6.3.1.2 Reviewing the post After you create your post and click the “Review your question” button, you will have an opportunity to check your post for a couple of potential issues. Duplicates. You want to try your best to make sure your question isn’t a duplicate question. Meaning, you want to make sure that someone else hasn’t already asked the same question or a question that is very similar. As you are typing your post title, Stack Overflow will show you a list of potentially similar questions. It will show you that list again as you are reviewing your post. You should take a moment to look through that list and make sure you question isn’t going to be a duplicate. If it does end up being a duplicate, Stack Overflow moderators may tag it as such and close it. Typos and errors. Of course, you also want to check your post for standard typos, grammatical errors, and coding errors. However, you can always edit your post later if an error does slip through. You just need to click the edit text at the bottom of your post. A screenshot from the example post is shown in the screenshot below. 6.3.2 Creating better posts and asking better questions There are no bad R programming questions, but there are definitely ways to ask those questions that will be better received than others. And better received questions will typically result faster responses and more useful answers. It’s important that you ask your questions in a way that will allow the reader to understand what you are trying to accomplish, what you’ve already tried, and what results you are getting. Further, unless it’s something extremely straight forward, you should always provide a little chunk of data that can serve as an example of the data you are working with. This is so important that there is an R package that does nothing but help you ask good questions called Reprex. Additionally, Stack Overflow and the RStudio community both publish guidelines for posting good questions. Stack Overflow guide to asking questions: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask RStudio Community Tips for writing R-related questions: https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-tips-for-writing-r-related-questions/6824 You should definitely pause here an take a few minutes to read through these guidelines. If not now, come back and read them before you post your first question on either website. Below, we show you a few of the posts we’ve created and highlight some of the most important features of those posts. 6.3.2.1 Example posts Here are a few examples of questions we’ve posted to Stack Overflow and the RStudio community. Feel free to look them over. Notice what was good about these posts and what could have been better. The specifics of these questions are totally irrelevant. Instead, look for the elements that make posts easy to understand and respond to. Stack Overflow: Using filter() with across() to keep all rows of a data frame that include a missing value for any variable RStudio Community: Using filter() with across() to keep all rows of a data frame that include a missing value for any variable Stack Overflow: What is the differnce between . and .data? RStudio Community: Arrange calculated columns immediately after source columns when using dplyr column-wise operations 6.3.2.2 Question title Make sure your question/post has a succinct, yet descriptive, question title. A case could be made that the titles above would be made more clear by adding a reference to the software we’re asking a question about. In this case, R, and more specifically, dplyr. Remember, people come to Stack Overflow to ask questions about many different programming languages. R is just one of them. In this case, we tagged our Stack Overflow questions as being about R instead of writing “R” in the question text. 6.3.2.3 Explanation of the issue Make sure your question/post has a brief, yet clear, explanation of what we are trying to accomplish. For example, “Sometimes I want to view all rows in a data frame that will be dropped if I drop all rows that have a missing value for any variable. In this case, I’m specifically interested in how to do this with dplyr 1.0’s across() function used inside of the filter() verb.” 6.3.2.4 Reproducible data Make sure your question/post includes a small, reproducible data set that helps others recreate your problem. This is so important, and so often overlooked by students in our courses. Notice that we did NOT say to post the actual data you are working on for your project. Typically, the actual data sets that we work with will have many more rows and columns than are needed to recreate the problem. All of this extra data just makes the problem harder to clearly see. Here is an example of a small, reproducible data set that I created for the post above about using filter() with across(). It only has 5 data rows and 3 columns, but the solution solving the problem for the small data set will # Load the dplyr package. library(dplyr) # Simulate a small, reproducible example of the problem. df &lt;- tribble( ~id, ~x, ~y, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, NA, 1, 4, 0, 0, 5, 1, NA ) RStudio Community Reproducible Examples and the reprex package https://community.rstudio.com/t/video-reproducible-examples-and-the-reprex-package/14732 🗒Side Note: Please remember to cross-link your posts if you happen to create them on both Stack Overflow and RStudio Community. When I say “cross-link” I mean that you should add a hyperlink to your RStudio Community post on your Stack Overflow post and a link to your Stack Overflow post on your RStudio Community post. Next, let’s learn how to make a post. 6.4 Helping others Eventually, you will get to a point where you are able to help others.
